<p align="justify">The estimates of right and wrong are arbitrary. You cannot even be sure that you are doing the right thing. Moral judgment is subjective. The ethical compass obeys the will of man. All that remains is the certainty that nothing can be sure. Everything is so vague. Contradictions between justice and necessity. The opposition of intuition and intelligence. Previously, we just wanted to end the conflict at any cost. Historical experience has become our teacher. We followed his rules and suffered from diligence.</p>

<p align="justify">Of course, there have been plenty of terrible ideas in the past. However, there should be better options in the future. We begin to realize the inevitable. The most understandable of the currents of history is the impossibility of building tyranny with a large crowd. Absolute power is a much more difficult task than authoritarian theorists have assumed. Tyranny cannot be condemned unequivocally just because its principles and practices have failed. The tyranny of the masses stems from the confluence of objective social conditions.</p>

<p align="justify">The establishment of power by an overwhelming crowd is based on boundless violence. After the establishment of the hierarchy in the state, power will formally be in the hands of the elect - not by democratic voting, but in battles of cunning and cruelty. This means that neither the need for popular power nor the aversion to sublime predators will disappear. Power is the link between the necessary and the impossible.</p>

<p align="justify">The hope of the population is like a weather system in which a storm can strike at any moment. When ties get out of control, the crowd takes advantage of all the powers of the state and uses them in their own lower interests. The number of players who can rewrite the rules will outweigh the influence of those who benefit from their existence. Once there is no choice left, tyranny will be destroyed.</p>

<p align="justify">Tyranny should not seize power by making a deal with the devil. The statement is fair but unnecessary. A crash starts with creating a trap and ends with hitting it. The crowd sets a master over itself only for demonstrative destruction of the despot at the first whim. Among the innumerable characters, there is always a man ready to pull the trigger.</p>
