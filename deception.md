# üé≠ Honest Deception üé≠
<p align="justify">You are funny little mortals. The God of deception and illusion wants you to believe that he does not need your help. Of course, we understand what he means. The magician just wants to play with us. If we are intelligent beings, then we can surely see his tricks. Mortals cannot keep secrets for long. Hence, the gods must be careful not to be caught red-handed. Divine language is not human, but it is human enough for us to understand.</p>

<p align="justify">Language as a system of mutually contradictory descriptions and formulas does a great job in our minds. Namely, by comparing a formal language with sets of operators in another language, it is possible to determine whether there are several equivalent descriptions from the set that make the two languages identical. Such a construction, although impracticable due to inconsistency, remains extremely important because it is equivalent to defining a formal language by specifying all the statements that can be expressed in it.</p>

<p align="justify">One interesting conclusion follows from this, which, despite all desires, mathematicians of the past could not believe. Mathematical truth is unattainable in the syntax of a formal system. Whether we like it or not, we always speak the truth in the language of deception. This allows you to better understand the world around you. But isn't this a state of omnipotence? Logicians say that any possible conclusion is available to us from contradiction. Omnipotence is a trivially contradictory property. However, we are not omniscient. And yet, we are not omnipotent. We are simply talented, and any god who says otherwise will be a liar. Some people would probably find it soothing. The rest will be annoyed.</p>

<p align="justify">It's raining. You look out the window, but you can only see a black dot in a gray sky. When you try to add new touches to an old picture, you simply introduce contradictions into it that will not change the essence of the matter. The gray color of the pitiful sky already contradicts its nature, because the skies should not be dry and wet at the same time. We've seen it all before. There is no rain outside the window, only a pitiful gray sky. The sky is too gray to be blue. Mortals must learn a lesson for themselves. But they haven't figured out which one yet.</p>
