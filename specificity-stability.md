<p align="justify">It is easier for authoritarian regimes to stay in rich countries. After all, then the regime has the money to maintain power and the overthrow is not attractive enough for the population. In contrast, in poor countries, it is much more difficult to maintain the status quo. Resource-constrained authoritarianism is under double pressure from elites hoping for a coup and populations hoping to change things. Does this mean that the more prosperous a society is, the more likely it is to withstand an authoritarian regime?</p>

<p align="justify">In many cases, the choice of democracy or authoritarianism is not determined by economic factors. Elites can choose a democratic system because they believe that reforms will allow them to gain greater privileges, even if most people do not benefit from the changes. For example, India is a multinational country, and the dictatorship of one cultural group, while causing great controversy, will grant tremendous power to the chosen elite. Nonetheless, destabilization will lead to even greater poverty than any existing one today. At the end of the day, the future of each country will be decided by people, not self-appointed leaders.</p>
