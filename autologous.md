# ‚ôüÔ∏è Autologous Singularity ‚ôüÔ∏è

<p align="justify">Singularity is a theoretical concept that implies the creation of artificial intelligence that can reproduce its creation. In general, it seems pretty obvious that the final cycle does not have infinite explanatory power. It is clear that for each logical transition, new grounds may be required. A finite explain loop cannot satisfy the stringent requirements of the explain standard, even if you allow looping logic.</p>

<p align="justify">The question is, what are the limits of your abilities and the abilities of other beings? Any topic can be discussed endlessly. It is only a matter of time before discussions on the topic become a separate topic requiring clarification. It's the same with singularities. If we don't know how they work, why should we care about them?</p>

<p align="justify">You may argue that the very nature of life in this world has been sufficiently studied. That is, when we try to explain everything that exists, the procedure that makes the chains of explanations endless appears in explicit form. Conversely, when we try to put things in order and put this infinity in a loop, it is not at all clear how this order can be established.</p>

<p align="justify">There are several interpretations of the logic loop. These interpretations are not mutually exclusive. You may have your own explanation of the process. In any case, we can all be sure of one important fact. We should not nominally introduce an absolute category of the type of god to whom all questions apply and who overshadows everything like a black hole. The idea of such a god is absurd.</p>

<p align="justify">When we talk about the logic of an explanation, we in no way assume that it exists. Nihilism is preferable to building The Tower of Babel of mathematical logic. It is preferable to use the induction method, which is at least a proven procedure. Otherwise, any given topic can be constructively looped. In this case, the cycle can include a discussion of the nature of God, which cannot be said about other models.</p>

<p align="justify">We must now ask, is the concept of God logically necessary? It is very difficult to enumerate everything that requires an explanation in order to avoid the absurd metaphysics of universal grounds. The idea of God is the basis for the idea of the laws of nature, of which there are many, including the laws of logic. The cycle always sets the boundaries and explains the limited area of discourse they have limited. The concept of God will probably be necessary, but that does not mean that it is reasonable.</p>

<p align="justify">This approach does not work if you are trying to explain everything at once and keep at least some relevance. The concept of the cycle allows for an unlimited number of explanations in a limited area. There is no logical reason to believe that other creatures could be included in the cycle. This is similar to how all possible mathematics cannot be rewritten into a set of axioms, although axiomatization works quite well in limited areas.</p>

<p align="justify">The concept of the cycle also allows for the explanation of some of the less logical concepts in the world. Logic that is rational for some structures ceases to cope with another type of structure. A good example is the idea of objective morality. While the concept of God is always rational, the concept of objective morality is not.</p>

<p align="justify">A concept of a god can be rational. The problem is that a god can only be a god in the same way that a circle can only be a circle, even if it works perfectly well as a square. Using loops is not a problem. Using logic becomes a problem. Of course, the concept of God is useful for other purposes as well. Religion provides a powerful method of controlling large groups of people. In attempts to explain virtually infinite structures in terms of finite categories, absurd explanations are usually introduced that cannot support the adequacy of the reasoning.</p>

<p align="justify">For example, it is widely believed that the concept of God is a logical necessity. This argument states that it is impossible to imagine life without the gods. This is a false statement. Singularities of justification selfishly condense all explanations around them in order to maintain their universality. The absolute paradigm of justification always leads to the absurd collapse of logic, since all theories based on one justification are doomed to fail.</p>
