<p align="justify"><i>‚ÄúIn any era, the ideas of the ruling class prevail.‚Äù ‚Äî Karl Marx</i></p>


<p align="justify">Harry Potter is a very interesting book. It explains how Marxists think and why they do what they do. To begin with, magic is financial capital controlled by wizards from all over the world. For example, the purebred Slytherin personifies the aristocracy who believe they have a right to wealth simply by birth. Ravenclaw in its intellectualism personifies the stratum of the bourgeois intelligentsia. Hufflepuff is less important and represents the petty bourgeoisie willing to succumb to fascism and other right-wing ideologies.</p>

<p align="justify">All wizards oppress the Muggles, that is, the proletariat as if they were inferior people. Hogwarts, that is capitalism, turns a blind eye to the hard work of workers and deprives them of the right to the magic of capital, the possession of which would improve their quality of life. House-elves are artisans with no class consciousness who believe the current system is fair. The Dursleys, archaic forces that deny the teachings of Marx and do not realize the very existence of capitalism, have gone not far from them.</p>

<p align="justify">It is worth noting that while wizards are reluctant to admit that Mudbloods are capable of learning magic, most wizards still regard the nouveau riche as second-class. Education at Hogwarts is not tied to the realities of working life. Wizards learn only the correct handling of the magic sphere. Likewise, the bourgeoisie learns to manipulate money, leaving heavy production to the workers. The magical disciplines are varied, but the most important of them is the defense against the dark arts, that is, the oppression of minorities in the service of the interests of the ruling class.</p>

<p align="justify">Another allegory is Quidditch, the capitalist wage race. The hunters and the goalkeepers are workers and peasants who invest the most in the game but are forced to compete with each other. Beaters are military forces that, while appearing to be at war with each other, actually suppress the productive forces. The Seeker is a capitalist who single-handedly wins the financial game by catching the golden snitch, that is, making a profit, thereby devaluing the work of all other players.</p>

<p align="justify">Now let's talk about our heroes. About the communists! The colors of Gryffindor are yellow and red. Undoubtedly, this is a transparent allusion to Soviet symbols. Dumbledore, with his imposing gray beard, sharp mind, and central role in the book, is undoubtedly Karl Marx. Harry Potter's unkempt black hair and glasses make him identical to Leon Trotsky. The lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead is a reference to Trotsky's fatal injury with an ice pick. Ron Weasley and Hermione are the luminaries of socialism, Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg.</p>

<p align="justify">The two compositions of the Order of the Phoenix undoubtedly represent the First and Second Internationals. The mythological image of the Phoenix, which burns in the fire and is reborn from the ashes, has clear parallels with the flame of the world revolution. Bolshevism will also destroy the rotten bourgeois world and build a just society on its ruins. Opposing the heroes, the Death Eaters embody the forces of fascism, chauvinism, and counter-revolution. And they can be defeated only by relying on love born in the brotherhood and equality of peoples.</p>

<p align="justify">Snape is Stalin. He was a harsh teacher at the beginning of the book, but now is more of a complicated anti-hero. He kills Dumbledore, thereby achieving his goals, just like Stalin changed Marxist doctrine to achieve the goals that Marx set for the proletariat. Dolores Umbridge is a liberal democracy that tries to make a sweet impression but turns into an insidious oligarchy. Unsurprisingly, she relies on the Dementors of alienation and bureaucracy. Finally, there is Rita Skeeter, the fake news distributor, and warmonger.</p>

<p align="justify">Voldemort personifies the consumer society. The central ideology of such a society is fetishism generated by the fear of death. Its symbol is Horcruxes, status items, and symbolic relics of the old world order. However, the soul is immortal, and the immortality of the soul means that the choice of a materialistic object for its embodiment is absurd. Consumers find superficial identity in status trinkets. While their destruction makes the Dark Lord realize that he has not spiritually evolved as a human.</p>

<p align="justify">The theme of censorship runs through the novel as a red thread. The main characters timidly avoid even mentioning He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. When people talk about him at all, they speak in the language of euphemisms, and only Marx does not hesitate to call a spade a spade. Just as bashfully the modern press is afraid to raise the topic of the crisis of late capitalism. Rowling artfully portrays the Dark Lord as a powerful but soulless and de facto dead wizard. Equally powerful, but spiritless is the model of modern capitalism, rotting from within.</p>
