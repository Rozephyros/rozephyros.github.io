# ‚è≥ „Äé Illusions Always Die „Äè ‚è≥
<p align="justify">You are not sure whether to worry or rejoice about this, but again, neither anxiety nor euphoria will last forever. Any tradition is nothing more than a fragile illusion that will disappear as soon as people stop playing along with it, and each of them is doomed to be erased into dust by the silent passage of time.</p>

<p align="justify">The only thing you can do now is wait and see what happens next. You have gone too far in your life and you feel like you can never go back to where you started. Everyone can boldly surrender and watch as one after another, without his support and intervention, houses of cards will fall in a matter of seconds, the construction of which took hundreds of years. But that doesn't make sense when they are all doomed to fail anyway. It would be better if you stayed here in your daily routine, where nothing is achieved and everything remains the same.</p>

<p align="justify">Few will agree to confirm their belief in the eternity of values that are higher than the current ones, with real actions, and not with pretentious words. You cannot do that either, and you have no choice but to observe others from afar. Watch them make the same mistakes that you once did. There is no need to explain that the future belongs only to those who can step over the past.</p>

<p align="justify">The clock is always ticking. The clock is always ticking. You look again at the picture of the present, trying to understand what it can mean and if there is at least some deeper meaning in it. –í—ã, –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã—Ç—å, —Å–±–∏–ª–∏—Å—å —Å–æ —Å—á–µ—Ç–∞. You must have lost count. How many times have you done this?</p>

<p align="justify">You were right the first time. This is not your native landscape. No more. Or maybe it was not there from the very beginning. You were right the first time. This is not your native landscape. No more. Or maybe it was not there from the very beginning. One real brushstroke. Instead of thousands of meaningless phrases and arguments about your imaginary superiority over things that you absolutely cannot, if not stop or change, then at least simply accept.</p>

<p align="justify">You will be alone again. No more dreams, no more hopes, no more fear, no more love, no more hate. Nothing more. This is where it all ends. Don't think that you can cleanse the soul of every person of standard behavior patterns. You can't call the desired concentrate the only philosopher's stone out of billions of possibilities, and everything else as gold for fools.</p>

<p align="justify">You are the last survivor. The last representative of an endangered breed. There is no one like you. You are the original, the rebel, the thinker, the doer, the survivor. For the world, objective, like the movement of heavenly bodies, there is only one wealth - the fleeting reality of the present. In the end, everything returns to dust.</p>

<p align="justify">But you will not return to dust. You can survive. And one day someone will find this place and read these words.</p>
