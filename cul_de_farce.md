<p align="justify">A state of balance that exists due to the absurdity of the situation. When all that remains is to play along with the madness and hope for the best. It's simple. Blame those who try to dream without imagination. Blame those who build castles without being an architect. Most importantly, blame yourself for living within ridiculous boundaries. It is absolutely insane to cling to the only option in a world created by probabilities and possibilities.</p>

<p align="justify">When the expected approaches the imaginary, the illusion of control over the script arises. And yet, performances of reason cannot be staged on the stage of life. Events cannot be deleted from historical plots. We can only rationally play the cards that fell to us. The future is a deck that includes despair with hope, failure with success. Nothing prevents you from thinking through all the options when there is no point in counting on any of the trump cards.</p>

<p align="justify">People who don't expect anything good are just as blind as those who blindly believe in the best. The pessimist differs from the optimist only in the chosen side of neglect, the beloved ghost of truth. Confidence is not guaranteed, development exceeds forecasts. What separates us from the happy ending is not a lack of opportunity, but a commitment to the strategy.</p>

<p align="justify">People who paint one option and one scenario are doomed to fail. They don't build castles with all their hidden spans and foundations. They just admire their appearance. You don't have to be a fool to play the smart game. The smartest move is not to fight reality, but to enter into dialogue with the universe. Most events are developing contrary to expectations. When this happens, all that remains is to laugh, smile, and look for the next opportunity. Never forget this fact, and your chances of a happy life will skyrocket.</p>
