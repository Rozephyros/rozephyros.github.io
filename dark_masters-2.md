<p align="justify">Existence exists. It takes on meaning at the multidimensional level of recursion when the qualia of an individual being become the outermost part of its maximal membrane. Human existence is not only a physical body but also the mental and emotional qualities that make him who he is. The human mind knows no bounds in what it can imagine. If you think that reality exists simply for no reason, then you have never immersed yourself in science, mathematics, or philosophy. You are still stuck in your little world.</p>

<p align="justify">In practice, however, the problem lies in the fact that humans live in an illogical world and the more you know about reality, the more illogical it will seem. However, in practice, the problem is that people want to live in an illogical world, and the less a person knows about reality, the more he wants it to seem illogical. The human mind is a complex mixture of neurons and synapses, but ultimately these are the same vibrating strings that make up the rest of reality. Hawking shows that we can think of neurons as nodes through which information signals pass, which are amplitudes in the sum of histories at the macro level.</p>

<p align="justify">Too narrow a point of view on reality and consciousness, in which their existence is explained by chance, is meaningless. The brain is a quantum computer that decodes the fluctuations of probabilities that shape reality and makes them an abstraction of consciousness. This explains how the mind arises from a purely physical system. All other properties of consciousness are determined by information. But what is information and which theory to trust? Only the many-worlds interpretation is able to combine quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity, applying summation to higher dimensions: stories of time and alternative universes. When we trust the many-worlds theory, we see the birth of a recursive order of things.</p>
