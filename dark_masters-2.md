<p align="justify">Existence exists. It takes on meaning at the multidimensional level of recursion when the qualia of an individual being become the outermost part of its maximal membrane. Human existence is not only a physical body but also the mental and emotional qualities that make him who he is. The human mind knows no bounds in what it can imagine. If you think that reality exists simply for no reason, then you have never immersed yourself in science, mathematics, or philosophy. You are still stuck in your little world.</p>

<p align="justify">In practice, however, the problem lies in the fact that humans live in an illogical world and the more you know about reality, the more illogical it will seem. However, in practice, the problem is that people want to live in an illogical world, and the less a person knows about reality, the more he wants it to seem illogical. The human mind is a complex mixture of neurons and synapses, but ultimately these are the same vibrating strings that make up the rest of reality. Hawking shows that we can think of neurons as nodes through which information signals pass, which are amplitudes in the sum of histories at the macro level.</p>

<p align="justify">Too narrow a point of view on reality and consciousness, in which their existence is explained by chance, is meaningless. The brain is a quantum computer that decodes the fluctuations of probabilities that shape reality and makes them an abstraction of consciousness. This explains how the mind arises from a purely physical system. All other properties of consciousness are determined by information. But what is information and which theory to trust? Only the many-worlds interpretation is able to combine quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity, applying summation to higher dimensions: stories of time and alternative universes. When we trust the many-worlds theory, we see the birth of a recursive order of things.</p>

<p align="justify">Thus, there is no afterlife for man. In the worst case, consciousness reverts to the recursive order of things. For modern physics, all this is not a revelation. Instead of universal consciousness, development obeys the ‚Äúmodeling of the past‚Äù and is linked by chains of causality. This simulation is more ghostly than a gross brain in a jar. What is left for people to do when the reality is imposed as an end in itself? Man is free to follow his desires. And wizards differ from ordinary people in that they want to see how reality collapses before our eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">In the interval between local perception and global recursion, original sin is born. The tension of attention on the subtle structure of reality leads to several mental illnesses. The ability to concentrate for hours in front of a monitor requires a certain personality type. In ancient times, one who attained enlightenment through meditation was called Buddha. As soon as the enlightened one finds a way to rid others of the distortions of the mind, religion is born. Everyone will be faced with difficult choices: surrender or strive for enlightenment. Ignorance will lead to a boring and meaningless life in flight from reality, and spiritual courage will be perceived by society as madness.</p>

<p align="justify">Christianity is based on the reality of original sin. The crucifixion of Jesus did not save human consciousness. Original sin, unlike the description of creation, is not a literary device that can be understood allegorically. For a world dominated by recursion, the habit of consciousness to isolate itself from the obvious remains unchanged. When Jesus escaped death and rose from the dead as a prophet, he could not deliver people from congenital blindness. Even the most faithful apostles who preached Christian doctrine were tragically killed for their own suffering.</p>
