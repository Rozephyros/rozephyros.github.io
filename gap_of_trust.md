<p align="justify">The state exists thanks to solidarity. This is the only working foundation. When the government chooses the military option, the status of power is reduced to a group of oligarchs with brutal mercenaries. The use of forceful methods transfers the central conflict from the format of the struggle between groups to the format of struggle within the group. Once the illusion is destroyed, people cease to act in the interests of the state.</p>

<p align="justify">An attempt to take advantage of the situation and use hatred for political interests is the only thing that can save despotism. The first step is to get rid of the opposition. The second step is to eliminate staunch opponents. The third step is to turn brother against brother. It is naive to think that people supposedly do not understand what is happening. People always have more freedom of choice than despotism. People continue to analyze what is happening, albeit in the logic of a new situation.</p>

<p align="justify">From now on, talk about external enemies is perceived not as strategic analytics, but as cheap propaganda. The first step is to get rid of the lie. The second action is to curtail the privileges of the oligarchy. In the end, when everyone is against the despot, he will be forced to leave the country. He will have no choice but to accept the victory of freedom. More is not required. The last despot faced with an inevitable choice agreed to live forever in the Italian countryside. In a few years, his generals would die in an avalanche crossing the Alps.</p>
