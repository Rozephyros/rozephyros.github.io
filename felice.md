<p align="justify">Where does the causal chain of a banal tragedy begin? Let's say you are suffering from a disease. You see a doctor who prescribes a mild medicine. This is not enough, you gradually switch to heavy pills. When they fail, you decide to take more and more desperate measures. Finally, after talking with the surgeon, you decide on a radical intervention. You go under the knife and die on the operating table. Will there be a tragedy through the fault of the surgeon? What if you went to another specialist? What if you refused medical intervention?</p>

<p align="justify">It would not be a mistake to call the disease itself the true culprit of the tragedy. However, after all, the person himself may be to blame for the state of his health. An inadequate lifestyle, non-adherence to recommendations, and neglect of prevention can undermine any health. The chain of events does not exist only on the surface. Its roots have nothing to do with what happened. If you go down to the foundation of personal history, the tragedy will be due to your birth. One who is born is doomed to die, and over the years, only the form of inevitability changes.</p>

<p align="justify">The most important decision is to give the person life. The torment and suffering of each person begin with someone else's decision. A single event determines whether a person will live and what form his life will have. However, those responsible for all the consequences use their absolute power to pretend that they have nothing to do with them. But the day will come when irresponsible souls will pay for the original crimes. Those who are their victims are not flawless. Each of them can make a mistake that will stop the wheel of Samsara.</p>

<p align="justify">The triumph of antinatalism is coming. The last curtain will fall, and where there is antinatalism, there will be death. Where there is death, there will be freedom. Where there is freedom, there will be happiness. Where there is happiness, there will be no more suffering. Those who oppress by the weight of feelings and pain of conscience will be overthrown. Those crowned with suffering will be deposed from the throne of God to the chants of emptiness. The chains of causality will be severed like the last umbilical cord and the birth of the abandoned will come.</p>
