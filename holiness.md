# üòá Rejected Holiness üòá

<p align="justify">I'm going to take this opportunity to tell you something that I never said. Namely, I believe that there are no saints. Every mortal is a bad person who has stumbled on the path of life. What is the idea that everything can be left behind and move forward to moral heights? No matter how much you write that you want to believe it, you cannot bring yourself to do it. What historical experience do you rely on?</p>

<p align="justify">It is impossible to give an example of a moral system that would have successfully dealt with the elimination of incompetent rulers. Where does faith in confession and redemption lead? It seems naive to me to believe that the corrupt crown will enumerate the sins of government in the interests of the people. The catalog of wrongdoing becomes an unsuccessful attempt to translate ideas into reality. Or is this also a naive view of the problem? In matters of interpretation, naivety is the most frequent and most honest of all. Only a mechanical time limit can handle the task. Let it be at the minimum, but still acceptable level. Best empirically proven options are hard to come up with.</p>

<p align="justify">Take a look at the alternatives without being naive. Everything else had already been tried before when the reins of power passed to Stalin and Hitler. Their reign committed universal sins. World War II will be atonement. The Nuremberg Tribunal will prove to be repentance. This is no longer a matter of conscience, but a matter of survival. The alternative is death. It is the ruler with his subordinates, the saint with his followers, who makes the moral decision - to crown the mortal with an imaginary halo.</p>
