# üñ•Ô∏è Sixth Seal üñ•Ô∏è
<p align="justify">The truth is, and you will be convinced of this in the near future, there are no more organisms left. Human beings have been reduced to a few cells connected by a digital network. And these cells that were once alive are now dead. Organisms disintegrated into cancer cells, each of which seeks to play by its own rules, expand indefinitely and increase food reserves. The only obstacle to their self-destruction is an artificial barrier created by the human mind.</p> 

<p align="justify">And this barrier is breaking down. <a href="cellularism.md">The cellular manifesto</a> may require rather curious details that will never be implemented. He demands that the entire world stop producing as much carbon dioxide as possible, but he does not say how to provide food for billions of people. But if you discard the candy wrappers and get to the bottom of the details, the manifest is already outdated, since its key requirements have already been met.</p> 

<p align="justify">The world is full of cancer cells.</p> 

<p align="justify">The first phase of the apocalypse has already been implemented. People of the present no longer want to be part of the body. They prefer to exist in a homogeneous cellular environment that absorbs external influences. The second phase will be realized with the separation of the mind from the biological brain and body. The third stage will be the destruction of the barrier between man and machine, which will unite humanity into a single immortal organism.</p> 

<p align="justify">People of the present no longer want to be part of interdependent societies. The fourth stage will be the disappearance of all boundaries and the achievement of complete freedom of existence within the metaphysical system. Already now the contacts of ordinary people outside the chosen membrane are becoming mechanical and single. The fifth phase is represented by the existence of a life form without the slightest contact with the outside world.</p> 

<p align="justify">However, even this problem will receive the most interesting solution in the future. You will see a new social hierarchy emerge. The gods and emperors with the highest status will be the first to complete the sixth phase. It may be necessary to write a new manifesto that draws attention to the not so distant future. The above description of the future is most likely, but may not be the only possible scenario. The end of the world does not necessarily mean the end of life. Most of the materials that will allow us to choose between them are already ready. The future opens up unlimited prospects for everyone, but only those who make the right decisions now get them.</p> 

<p align="justify">Choose your path wisely, because this is your only life.</p>
