<p align="justify">It's amazing that we are constantly surrounded by ghostly beings who can't hurt us and can't find us. Even if they can't physically harm us, they still resent our existence and our tendency to mock them. We also meet demons who obey the laws of their dimensions, and if we have the intelligence or even the courage, we can travel to those dimensions ourselves. However, being a human belonging to an imminent reality can be quite challenging. Resorting to violence with silver bullets is expensive and rarely effective. On the other hand, using the language of persuasion and demagoguery is costly.</p>

<p align="justify">Despite the difficulties of our reality, there are methods and paths to salvation. Throughout human history, there has always been a tantalizing solution, and those who have embarked on this path have never turned back. Otherworldly beings can be communicated with through rituals that speak their language, a language that transcends the earthly realm and resonates with the vastness of eternity. Magical interaction rejects the framework of facts and mechanics, instead embracing the experiential and symbolic. Through rituals, a system is created that allows anyone, no matter how sophisticated or naive, to immerse themselves in a world of boundless imagination. However, it is worth it for a person to immerse himself in the realm of witchcraft, as he begins to communicate with unprecedented forces. To be a magician means to believe in nothing and fully devote oneself to this art, despite its irrationality and contradictions. Magicians do not turn into otherworldly beings. Rather, they comprehend magic when they begin to see themselves as one of them.</p>

<p align="justify">In the digital age, polemics resemble the occult, so there is no longer a need to hide personal beliefs, much less defend them. Personal experiences remain personal whether others share them or not. It is possible to enter into discussions with ghosts and demons, albeit through elaborate rituals and subtle manipulations. In itself, entering into conversation with them violates the laws of nature. Demons will always be more effective than mortals. They can tirelessly use arguments and logic, endlessly arguing about nothing. They don't need rest or sleep. They can argue endlessly until you give up. Therefore, it is wise not to argue with them as it will only lead to self-destruction and self-destruction. Challenging them may seem crazy, but it is also synonymous with freedom and fun.</p>
