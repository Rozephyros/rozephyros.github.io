<p align="justify"><i>‚ÄúThoughts, ideas, opinions are not unlike wolves. When they howl together, nature tells them to gather in a pack. If a lone wolf dares to bark back, they hunt him down.‚Äù ‚Äî Friedrich Nietzsche</i></p>

<p align="justify">If objectification is an issue, then subjectification is no less an issue. Let me first explain what the issue of objectification is. Objectification occurs when society, instead of considering the living and breathing human as a whole, begins to reduce humans to a single function. Thus, a person begins to be seen as an object. The most common issue is sexual objectification, which occurs when a person is seen only in the context of how they can provide sexual gratification. Of course, this is not the only option for objectification. For example, a corporation may not see you as anything other than a workforce or source of income.</p>

<p align="justify">It's easy to see what the issue is. When the forces that reduce us to something less significant become powerful enough, we will cease to be human. We degrade to slaves, to objects, or worse. This will lead to oppression and suffering. Of course, sometimes people need to be a cog for the machine of society to run smoothly. But it is important to remember that this is the price paid, not the ideal we are striving for. We should live as humans, not as disgusting animals, data points, or fetishized objects.</p>

<p align="justify">Now let's talk about subjectification. This is no less a problem. Increasingly, a person is reduced to some kind of separate views, opinions, and feelings. We are no longer people who have real lives. Only superficial positions and outrageous statements remained. The victim of subjectification is not a person who lives and fights, creates and changes. They become a stereotype, a caricature, a cartoon character. One awkward word and you no longer deserve respect. You are no longer considered human. You are another ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàist, a magnet for ridicule, and a scoundrel for condemnation.</p>

<p align="justify">I often argue with people on the Internet who occupy a variety of positions, from inspiring and complex to absurd and insane, but I always remember that behind a tiny veil of subjectivity there is always a human with a story. This dude with a blatant opinion that's easy to hate? He can work as a doctor and save lives. This annoying Twitter girl? She may have suffered from some perverse form of domestic violence. These are not one-dimensional cardboard sketches for coloring with all the epithets. We must rise above the condemnation of people, of whom there is nothing left but a careless image that we ourselves impose on them.</p>
