<p align="justify">Any imprecise definition requires clarification. When we take definitions literally, the universe becomes subjective. Here, the subject is understood not only for the perspective of an observer but also for his mental abilities in a broad sense. The idea that cause and effect are born of free interpretation by the mind is not as absurd as mortals think. You did it right now, do you know that? You deny the conclusions because they contradict your intuition. I am amazed at your attempt to maintain the definition of the law of cause and effect.</p>

<p align="justify">I do not doubt that you are a great person and I respect your intelligence. However, it seems to me that you are too literal in matters of your faith. First, a definition is introduced. Then it is explained that a certain phenomenon should be considered subjective. However, you continue to insist that the definition does not need to be revised. In the end, you have to admit that the definition is wrong and that you were too stubborn to accept the reality around you.</p>

<p align="justify">This is not a matter of relativity. I admit that the speed of light depends on mass, but this has nothing to do with consciousness. When dependence does not require clarification, causality at the will of the subject becomes a form of dependence on the subject. If you disagree with this conclusion, do not hesitate to agree that the definitions require clarification. Otherwise, the absurdity penetrates reality and a colorful universe remains, in which the speed becomes subjective after pressing the pedal.</p>
