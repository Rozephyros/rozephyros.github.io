<p align="justify">The West seeks to establish its dominance over Russia by preventing it from competing in the economic, political and cultural arenas and seeking control over its natural resources. The damage caused by Russia in its so-called “war on the West” includes catastrophic casualties and destruction in Russia and Ukraine. On the other hand, the West has suffered only minor incidents such as the Nord Stream explosion and the accidental missile drop in Poland. Other losses suffered by the West are exaggerated and represent the accounted costs of containing Russia. Sanctions are imposed only when economically justified, and military equipment is not transferred to Ukraine when it is too important to Western interests.</p>

<p align="justify">The so-called “war on the West” does not include grandiose fairy tales that the Russians will turn the West into nuclear ash. Instead, Americans living in comfort give their pocket money every month to take the lives of Russian soldiers. On the other hand, a Russian soldier, risking everything, can at best destroy a decommissioned Western tank. The anti-Western camp in Russia, judging by its inability to fight back effectively against the West, seems to be engaged not in “war” but in the solemn sacrifice of Russian lives. To join their cause is to join the hecatomb.</p>
