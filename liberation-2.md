# 🕊️ Высшлее Освобождение 🕊️
<p align="justify">Complete liberation of the human spirit is when people cease to be satisfied with survival and instead focus on opening up our hearts to love others the way that we love themselves. It's taking control of the mind away from the big-business, the government and thought police, and returning us to the free, individual human mind.</p> 

<p align="justify">It's about freeing you from external opinion-forming filters. Permission for humans to be just as independent as our choices can allow, the concrete truthfulness of personal existence, the affirmation of values but not a forced commitment to them. Through compassion, we are empowered to reach the fullest potential that we crave.</p>
