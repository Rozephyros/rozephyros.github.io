<p align="justify">In the realm of time, once a moment has passed, there is no turning back. However, many things can be looked at from a new perspective in the present. But what is the “present” and what is it based on? The “present” seems to represent the most recent moment in time. According to postmodernism, the present is born out of the repetition of the past. The différance of different moments of time constitutes their essence. The present is reflected and repeated in both the past and the future. It is a continuous cycle of “before-after” — the past resurfaces in the future and the future is rooted in the past.</p>

<p align="justify">Postmodernism rejects notions of originality and linear chronology. Events cannot occur without repetition. Repetition is the source of existence itself. A new beginning is just a disguised version of the old, and a new start is just a thinly veiled retelling of a tired story. History repeats itself, and the present finds its definition and confirmation through repetition. “The present” is born out of the past, and the future is born out of the “present.” This eternal spiral of time leads us to an inevitable but unattainable destination. History is a timeless “present” that is both in the past and anticipated in the future. The “present” shapes who we have been and who we will become.</p>

<p align="justify">The concept of repetition is illustrated by the events of the “Infinite Eight” in the anime series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. In these eight episodes, the characters are trapped in a cycle of repeating events, with no control over their own history. Each episode tries to present events from a new perspective, but most episodes are indistinguishable from each other. In such a world, there is no point in following a storyline from the beginning because the events the characters face in each episode are identical. Repetition isn't just listening to an annoying recording of events that are knocked out of chronology. It is the experience of history that humanity faces at every moment in time.</p>

<p align="justify">This historical “present” exists because we are trapped in a spiral of time moving through the inertia of decisions and actions that seem new to us. Postmodernists call these eternal prisons “historical moments.” By “moment” we mean the infinite “present” in which we are stuck. The initial iteration of the Eight may seem original, but it is destined to merge with all subsequent iterations. The chronology is superficial, the order of events only creating the illusion of originality. However, the very first cycle of repetition in the second episode robs all subsequent episodes of originality. Everything around us is a melancholy repetition, including the first step toward nothingness. Consider the significance of man’s first step. It may seem momentous, but is it really the most important step in a person’s life? As for the future, everything old becomes new if you forget it well.</p>

<p align="justify">Postmodernism accepts repetition without judgment or denial. It does not matter whether one strives to create something original in the illusion of the “present” or relies on tired clichés over and over again. “Real” dissolves in the endless repetition and redefinition of history. History becomes more “present” and our actions have less and less impact on the past or future. Instead of living exclusively in the “present” moment, we are left yearning for a life that is truly authentic.</p>
