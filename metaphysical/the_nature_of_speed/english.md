# üåê The Nature of Speed üåê

<p align="justify">When it comes to speed, comparing a person running at top speed to someone moving slower unambiguously indicates that the former is faster. However, this apparent understanding of speed does not mean that it is entirely subjective. In fact, the fundamental nature of speed exists independently of outside observers. Nevertheless, the assessment of speed is undoubtedly influenced by the subjective inclinations of those who observe it.</p>

<p align="justify">Is the intellect capable of impartial fairness and unbiased construction of objective categories? Take, for example, the contrast between a hunter who deeply appreciates the primal nature of danger and an urban dweller who perceives it as a threat. To make a subjective judgment, one must rely on preferences that are not intrinsic to objects but come solely from the mind.</p>

<p align="justify">This raises the question of whether the subjectivity of a category alone is sufficient to validate its existence. On the one hand, if the evaluations of a category depend on reason, then the category as a whole cannot be considered objective. On the other hand, if specific elements of a category are independent of the subject, this renders untenable the notion that the category is entirely subjective. Such interdependence is inherent in reality and is the boundary on which categories exist.</p>

<p align="justify">If measurements are independent of evaluations, then a category is not considered subjective. It follows that the subjectivity of a category serves as an independent criterion for its objective existence. To deny this is to assert that only objective categories exist, which is contrary to the purpose of reason to identify objects in reality through subjective perception.</p>

<p align="justify">The objectivity of a category is based on deep fundamental structures or regularities that are free from subjective evaluations. If even one element escapes speculative categorization, it rises above the sea of prejudice like the tip of an iceberg. In other words, categorical evaluations are inextricably linked to individual subjects. If all subjective judgments are discarded, what remains are pure facts that defy categorization.</p>
