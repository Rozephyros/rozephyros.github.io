<p align="left">Meteors are falling and countries are burning.</p>
  
<p align="left">We pray with hope, but the gods are silent.</p>
  
<p align="left">The arrogance of the invasion lasts six days.</p>
  
<p align="left">A voice of wrath descended from heaven:</p>

<p align="right">"Enough! The limit has been reached and there is no time left.</p>
  
<p align="right">You must forget about one of the planets!</p>

<p align="right">About the one that naively fades away.</p>

<p align="right">About the one that bears the name of the Earth!</p>

<p align="left">Calm down, buddy, this happened more than once,</p>
  
<p align="left">And no one was so worried!</p>

<p align="left">But if you want to live,</p>

<p align="left">You will have to forget about such a vivid dream."</p>

<p align="right">Waking up in a nightmare, the mortal world dozed off.</p>
  
<p align="right">Fear will destroy people, the tribunal has arrived.</p>

<p align="right">Chaos has risen. The Legion is reborn.</p>

<p align="right">The Pantheon of Forgotten Gods is back.</p>

<p align="left">They have power over fate, their goals are terrible:</p>
  
<p align="left">To bring pale and crimson destruction. </p>

<p align="left">Tibet is captured and Himalaya is corrupted,</p>

<p align="left">But this is not enough, they need the whole world!</p>

<p align="right">Bloody rivers flow in ruins,</p>

<p align="right">The landscape is shrouded in ashes. Let the corpses rot!</p>

<p align="right">We will no longer remember the rainbow days,</p>

<p align="right">The heat of lava burns the depths of the seas.</p>

<p align="left">The anthology of trouble knew no bounds.</p>
  
<p align="left">There is no sign of life on one of the planets.</p>

<p align="left">On the one that is drowning in vain in blood.</p>

<p align="left">On the one that forgot the name of the Earth.</p>

<p align="right">Destruction has passed the fateful path:</p>
  
<p align="right">Planets, systems, one after another.</p>

<p align="right">And before the light of the end comes,</p>

<p align="right">Everywhere is emptiness and everywhere is blackness.</p>
