# 👊「 Shape of Force 」👊
<p align="justify">Everybody has their plan until they get punched in the face. From this moment, the fun begins. Collision with real life. Do you grab a backup plan? Can you improvise according to the situation? Can you hold out even one more moment? Will you lose consciousness? Would you rather give up or die?</p>

<p align="justify">What is the difference between imitation and art, between a leader and a supporter? What is the difference between inspiration and self-confidence? Talents overthrow mediocrity to applause, but that's not the point. The master fails more times than the beginner even tries. From scratch, new opportunities open up. But is there a desire to achieve them? Only a person decides whether its strength has a worthy form. Fates change in the blink of an eye. Universes are rebuilding in seconds.</p>
