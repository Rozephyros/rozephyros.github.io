<p align="justify"><i>‚ÄúA certain subtlety is required to deal with an intelligent adversary. Ideas cannot be simply shot or squashed. They can only be outsmarted.‚Äù ‚Äî Theo Fenn, political advisor of the Manticore Empire.</i></p>

<p align="justify">‚ÄúMysterious enemy‚Äù in the minds of extremists means intellectuals in the broadest sense of the word. These are those who enthusiastically read, research, and discuss a wide variety of topics. To whatever ‚Äúmysterious force‚Äù they may belong, there is always a certain similarity between them. They are highly organized, rely on esoteric knowledge, and act with subtle nuances in mind. Such behavior is incomprehensible, unpleasant, and unacceptable for extremists. Why is this so? The explanation lies in psychological differences.</p>

<p align="justify">Extremists don't like to waste time thinking. They tend to discard inconvenient evidence and act impulsively. On the other hand, intellectuals are very interested in their surroundings. They want to understand everything about things and get as much information as possible. It is easy to see how intellectuals who develop complex and long-term strategies based on a rich evidence base are natural enemies of extremists and a source of constant suspicion and mistrust.</p>

<p align="justify">Some intellectuals naturally take ‚Äúcontrol positions‚Äù in society, for whom the use of strategy is much more valuable than spontaneous motivation, but their cognitive style is alien to extremists and is interpreted simplistically. Lacking a grasp of subtlety, extremists come to moral suspicion. When you slowly gather evidence, intellectuals coming to the same conclusions look like a conspiracy. If you rely primarily on impulsive decisions, the value of strategic meetings eludes you.</p>

<p align="justify">In the world of simplistic mental models, it's tempting to think in black-and-white terms and hyperbolic narratives. Simplified thinking is evident in the social media world too. A person who makes a thoughtful argument against simplistic extremist beliefs may be accused of trolling, shilling, or propaganda. Whether that's true or not is irrelevant. The accusation only serves to reinforce simplistic thinking. Without proper checks and balances, extremist thinking leads to self-destruction and social polarization.</p>

<p align="justify">Extremists and intellectuals have reasons to dislike each other, and they tend to view each other as a threat to their very existence. Intellectualism is a constant source of pressure on extremists. Unable to resist, they rely on comparative advantage in their ability to take impulsive, decisive, and intense action. However, their aggression often misses the mark because they lack strategy in setting goals and separating the fundamental from the non-essential. With each such mistake, the conflict between these two mental models only continues to worsen.</p>
