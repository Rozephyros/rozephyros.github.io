<p align="justify">Is speed subjective? In a private context, it can be recognized that speed is subjective. Vehicle speed is determined by subjective decisions. You can step on the pedal and move faster. Likewise, apples can turn blue if specially colored. However, speed is not inextricably linked to human effort. As an indicator of how fast you can move in any way, speed does not necessarily depend on your ability.</p>

<p align="justify">Time is just as subjective and in the same way, refracts understanding of the world around in favor of mortals. A driver in a car overtaking a pedestrian does not move through time faster than slow passers-by. Volitional action cannot exist without a subject, but the colors of subjective action cannot supplant objectivity. For example, if a driver decides to exceed the speed limit, he cannot absolve himself of responsibility. You cannot refuse a penalty on the pretext that speed must be objective and therefore completely independent of personal choice.</p>

<p align="justify">The problem with the human will as a source of subjectivity is that it does not explain why the police stop the offender at all. Opinion cannot exist without a subject. Nevertheless, the specificity of the objective category of speed is more important than volitional levers in the mechanics of a particular case. By the will of the subject or without a volitional decision, objective categories will continue to exist. The internal conflict between good and evil is something that everyone must resolve within themselves. The choice remains with the person, but the presence of a subjective choice is not an excuse for an objective violation of the law.</p>
