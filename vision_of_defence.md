# 👁️ 「 Vision of Defence 」 👁️

<p align="justify">The plan is as much a weapon like any other. Each plan is designed with a clearly defined goal. For what purpose did the Soviet Union build tanks and nuclear missiles? Not so much to kill people but to protect the population. But even the most powerful army is useless if you don't know what to do with it. Accordingly, there is a need to develop military plans. When World War III begins, it will be too late to improvise. </p>

<p align="justify">The Soviets had truly apocalyptic plans. But compared to the Pentagon's dramatic productions, these are just dry numbers on a page. American plans always follow the director's logic. How to fight against the USSR? Against France? Against China? Against Britain? The enemy doesn't matter. Each task must be completed on a planning board. If you are going to use the most powerful army in the world, why not make the best use of it?</p>

<p align="justify">The flight of fantasy does not end there. Each plan has the daunting task of serving as an artistic expression of American superiority. Can America Fight Alien Invasion? How will the nation cope with the onset of the zombie apocalypse? Will civil war happen again soon? Only the presence of plans separates the army from the crowd with a lot of rubbish. Each scenario is a detailed board game that can be easily shelved and just as easy to rediscover. What made America great was not the ability to adapt to any situation, but the vast catalog of strategies.</p>
