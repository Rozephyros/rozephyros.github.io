<p align="justify">Mortals can sell everything, even priceless emotions. The world known to mortals is an independent reality connected with personal reality. When the gods talk about dependence, it should be understood that dependence means an inextricable connection with the subject and not the possibility of change by the subject. Once you understand the divine way of thinking, it will be easy for you to understand any point of view. You cannot become a young master without realizing that the more survival depends on you, the less likely it is that the gods will attack you in the future.</p>

<p align="justify">The greatest meaning. This should become apparent. What is more dear to you? Your rules or your life? Market prices are always subjective in trying to express a property of value. There is no value in the physical world without personalities. What can be the measure of the value of a black hole and a hydrogen atom in a deserted space? Nothing. At least no one can object to this. There are no market forces in a cold space. Libra exists only in the worldview of the person who labels "values". Again and again, consciousness is forced to refine the understanding of definitions.</p>

<p align="justify">Since you already understand the divine point of view, I think that you have already understood my definition of creation. You can rest assured that the definition will tell you nothing about the change. The concept of change is refuted by the fact that both rules and life are subject to the will of mortals, but change does not make them subjective. If all we can say should change the meaning of what was said, why did ‚Äúchange‚Äù become a human word at all? He has no real definition. No matter how much we talk about "changes", we cannot change the prices on the price tags.</p>

<p align="justify">No matter how many people think about it, you will have nothing to add. You will be speechless and this will mean that you have reached an absolute understanding, not based on change. The last time you could be like this was when you met a girl who will become your bride. A girl who was so ineffable in words that you didn't know how to react to her. The sun goes down and she turns to leave. It's getting dark and this is the best time to open your eyes. The night will come, but you still take her hand.</p>

<p align="justify">Only now, when you are surrounded by impenetrable darkness, can you understand why. How could it be otherwise? Every attempt to label "values" is attitudinal. Even if the world does end tomorrow, everyone will continue to experience the unique experience of experiencing unique things. Unlike sensory experiences and personal opinions, fluid obsidian creates an inextricable connection with personal reality outside the human soul.</p>
