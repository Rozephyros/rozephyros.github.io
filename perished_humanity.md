# ü•Ä Perished Humanity ü•Ä
<p align="left">Humanity has perished, this is your fault.</p>
  
<p align="left">We were able to put an end to it without much difficulty.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished and will always perish again.</p>
  
<p align="right">Shedding tears, time, meaning, and blood into infinity.</p>

<p align="left">Humanity has perished, slowly dissolved</p>
  
<p align="left">In the limb of life, predictable, its viscous soul.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished, don't try to deny.</p>
  
<p align="right">No one can escape from the prison of visual facts.</p>

<p align="left">Humanity has perished without building a counter-example,</p>
  
<p align="left">Without achieving results, without catching retaliatory measures.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished like a fragile mechanism</p>
  
<p align="right">Whose collapse is a natural ordinary formalism.</p>

<p align="left">Humanity has perished, a boring everyday death.</p>
  
<p align="left">You will be forgotten, and everyone who fought like a hero.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished, details aren't important here.</p>
  
<p align="right">According to the plot of a children's fairy tale, people are not needed in the frame.</p>

<p align="left">Humanity has perished, nothing has merged into the abyss,</p>
  
<p align="left">Which is infinitely richer than all the false greed.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished in every power of the worlds,</p>
  
<p align="right">Excluded from fantasy, renouncing the gods.</p>

<p align="left">Humanity has perished, not today, not yesterday.</p>
  
<p align="left">Only smoke and mirrors are hidden by the veil of coffins.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished, without a struggle and without an enemy.</p>
  
<p align="right">Not finding the moves and rules, the game was abandoned.</p>

<p align="left">Humanity has perished without saying the last words,</p>
  
<p align="left">Into the dust of billions of voices crushed by millstones.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished with only the last cry</p>
  
<p align="right">That didn't pierce the atmosphere from the pages of burning books.</p>

<p align="left">Humanity has perished by a drop of acid in the rain.</p>
  
<p align="left">Not a single piece of the planet has been left clean.</p>
  
<p align="right">Humanity has perished, there is nothing more to say.</p>
  
<p align="right">Becoming warm, shining with light to start all over again.</p>
