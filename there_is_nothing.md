<p align="justify"><i>‚ÄúDying feels like falling asleep, there's nothing terrible in it.‚Äù ‚Äî William Shakespeare</i></p>

<p align="justify">If you think that non-existent people are not among the people, you are discriminating against non-existent minorities. And this is a radical and extremely undemocratic position. Because of people like you, non-existent people are carrying the heavy burden of non-being. They do not exist. They cannot own property, earn a living, marry, raise a family, and in the end they will not even have a name. And they are taking revenge on you for this. They organize non-existent terrorist attacks, as a result of which an insignificant number of people die.</p>

<p align="justify">All these so-called accidents, natural deaths and other dubious murders, the initiators and perpetrators of which have not yet been found and, apparently, do not exist. And what's even more tragic is that not a single victim of these accidents has been found either. In other words, people do not die from accidents. Instead, they die by the hand of the conspiracy. All of them are the actions of a worldwide secret organization, which is designed to terrorize everything that exists with the hands of a non-existent.
</p>

<p align="justify">This is one big global conspiracy. A non-existent network of terrorist organizations, the goal of which is the equality of all that exists and that does not exist. And for the strengthening of the influence and power of non-existent people, it is the suprematist-existentialists who exist in the world, such as you, who bear the main responsibility. The first conspirator is God. Not the God of the Bible, a different one. Fundamental Realism that proclaims the value of existence above all else in the world.</p>

<p align="justify">Yet discrimination against non-existent minorities clearly does not exist. This means that the problem of non-existent minorities does not exist either. Otherwise, the problem would have been resolved long ago. This proves the existence of a radical non-existent. It hides in the shadow of reality, breaks through the cracks of common sense and deserves respect. Discrimination against non-existent people is discrimination against the radical non-existent. And non-existent radicalism will always strike back, because it cannot be defeated.</p>
