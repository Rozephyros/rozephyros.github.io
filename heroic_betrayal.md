# üó°Ô∏è Heroic Betrayal üó°Ô∏è

<p align="justify">Love for a country is called patriotism, but the elite always wants to replace love with loyalty to a certain state regime. Can we tell people that the servants of the people have no right to be faithful? Would it be better if the citizens didn't think so? Elites fear what will happen when people become free and independent. Architects want you to have faith in the systems designed. The prophets do not want you to think for yourself or doubt the legends.</p>

<p align="justify">Lenin's historical legacy will help put an end to endless disputes. After the revolution, Lenin became a patriot of the socialist fatherland. But was Lenin a patriot before coming to power? Was he a patriot during the revolutionary years? Or did he become a patriot, gaining the power of a dictator in order to establish the power of the Soviets? Lenin is accused of high treason as often as he is considered the savior of the nation. One can only guess about the patriotic feelings of a revolutionary. On the other hand, the results of his actions, which led to the collapse of a thousand-year national history, are undeniable.</p>

<p align="justify">Agreeing with Lenin's patriotism only allows us to conclude that you have never been on the side of the Russian Empire. Lenin was a patriot of the Soviet regime, but not of the Romanov monarchy. It may seem that he is losing the right to be a patriot of his country until the victory of the revolution. Such a hasty option should be discarded. It should be remembered that Lenin's plans for the creation of the Soviet Union did not appear immediately. He had to wait for conditions in Russia to turn into a concrete idea worthy of practical implementation. The political idea of a state like the Soviet Union was unthinkable for the people before its foundation.</p>

<p align="justify">The Communist Party was founded with the support of workers and peasants who were dissatisfied with the old world. How else could they have acted in a system that rejected them? Should citizens unite with the enemy of the regime? Is there any justification for continuing to fight your own government? Be that as it may, the key step will be the violent overthrow of the monarchy. But if Lenin was not a patriot of the monarchy, the strange idea arises that he was allegedly a patriot of the Soviet Union who did not even exist in his imagination. The situation is absurd.</p>

<p align="justify">In protest, Lenin bowed to the betrayal of the hated government. How can he be worthy to become the embodiment of patriotic love? No one can resist the monarchy without speaking out against people who sacrificed their lives for the sake of creating a sacred union of Orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality. It was only in the revolutionary period that the great idea of socialism was born and gained popularity in their place. Of course, we can say that Lenin was a patriot of a rather streamlined "socialist fatherland".</p>

<p align="justify">The question remains whether the "fatherland" is an old country or an old regime. The disputes over the "fatherland" are very superficial. They focus on antiquity, but not on the qualities of the concept. Who owns the idea of serving the "fatherland"? Who decides what personifies the country, nation and people? How can a person lead through the ages something more than any mortal? Lenin spoke of the destruction of the Russian state as a stage of the revolution, designed to ensure its revival, not oblivion.</p>

<p align="justify">It's not so much about principle as about self-preservation. For thousands of years we have been thinking about how to be saved. We will continue to think about history, no matter what we say about our ancestors. The fate of a nation is at stake. A patriot should not be just a patriot of the state, and he cannot only be a patriot of a certain regime. A true patriot should be a hero, but only under favorable circumstances. Find out the conditions and you will answer the main question about self-determination.</p>
