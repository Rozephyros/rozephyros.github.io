![The Triumph of Freedom](image.png)

<p align="justify">The existence of the state is the result of the unity of society. The basis of any power lies in the public recognition it receives. However, when power relies solely on violence and coercion, the illusion of unity is destroyed. On the other hand, divisions in society allow for the diversification of power, serving as a counterweight to the state. Conflicts serve as a defense against tyranny by restraining power. Instead of competition between states, conflict arises within society itself. The use of force forces us to recognize the injustice of those in power, which weakens the state and undermines its legitimacy.</p>

<p align="justify">In this state of affairs, wealthy oligarchs supported by unprincipled mercenaries turn into despots who no longer serve the interests of the people. Citizens lose their motivation to act in the interests of the state. Therefore, as a last desperate step, despots resort to hate speech. The ruler, who is no longer the leader of society, becomes hysterical. The first cry is to destroy his opponents, followed by attempts to suppress free speech and finally by incitement of brother against brother. However, these panic cries fail to paralyze society. People are not naive and realize what is happening. They analyze the situation and realize that they have more power than any ruler. From that point on, talk of external enemies is seen as cheap propaganda.</p>

<p align="justify">The split in society provides balance in the universe and prevents the emergence of a single authoritarian force. Society begins to purge itself of hatred, and former enemies unite for the sake of a common future. In the end, everyone ends up in opposition to the dictator, who is forced to recognize the triumph of freedom.</p>
