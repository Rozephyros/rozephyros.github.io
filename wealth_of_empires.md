# üëë„Äå Wealth of Empires „Äçüëë

<p align="justify">You can't rely on a naive understanding of imperialism. The problem with many political models is that they do not take into account the dynamism of empires. How static do you think American or European society is? Infrastructure efficiency and privilege prestige become obsolete over time. The Third Rome can never be The Second, but The Second Rome is not a structural copy of The First. The empires of the new era are incompatible and incomparable with the "great" empires of antiquity.</p>

<p align="justify">The British Empire was never a "great" empire. Before colonization, old India was richer than new Britain. Colonization was paid for by the increased tax burden and the need to maintain prestigious services. As soon as poor England began to extract Indian resources, the standard of living began to reach parity. And yet it cannot be said that there was no imperialism, because at a certain point the countries became equally rich and economically equal partners. Equality of income growth between empire and periphery is compatible with imperialism. An empire with a slow initial growth begins to grow faster.</p>

<p align="justify">The periphery with rapid initial growth slows down in development. It turns out that prosperity on the outskirts of an empire does not always grow faster than in the center of the metropolis. The empire must expand to maintain the hegemony of the rulers. The negative influence of imperialism counterbalances income growth. However, an empire can afford to spend more taxes only as long as the single space is able to provide better services. The momentum of British imperialism is running out. England lost its economic advantage over India. The "great" empires are returning to their rightful place under the sun.</p>
