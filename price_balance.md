# üè∑Ô∏è Price Balance üè∑Ô∏è

<p align="justify">Although the numbers on the price tags are objective for independent consumers, they are not prices. The price should be understood as a criterion existing in the mind, on which a person relies when deciding to buy a consumer product. Price tags are based on fragments of consumer consciousness taken out of context, which is expressed in generally accepted symbols. This means that prices change by the power of thought, and price tags are carved out of granite.</p>

<p align="justify">The numbers do not depend on perception and therefore are not always relevant for discussion. An object that is independent of consciousness cannot be a full-fledged expression, because phenomenal experience implies secondary and subjectivity. The boldness of desires opens up new approaches. Based on phenomenology, you can move and even destroy objects, contrary to the states of matter. Constructions become just a formality that is taken into account when making decisions at the request of the theorist.</p>

<p align="justify">In whatever direction architects develop systems, their usual actions are directed towards a bright future. On the path of progress, humanity is judged by events and personalities. Historical figures have a hard time shedding magazine shoulder straps from rating stars. Each of the heroes of the past will be listed in the catalog, which ends only at the last price indicated by zero. It is important to remember that the ultimate critic is not required to judge merit. The editors can always just ascribe stars from the ceiling. There are no other value expressions other than secondary and illusory ones.</p>
