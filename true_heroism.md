<p align="justify">So what happened that the modern world suddenly began to demand radical changes? This is one of those questions that will need to be answered to understand what it means to be human.


<p align="justify">Think about what is specific. Something that exists. Something surely definite, accurate and substantive, material. What then is not specific? Something surely abstract, notional and nebulous. In other words, imaginary and symbolic entities.</p> 

<p align="justify">A natural opposition, abstract intuition against concrete sensation. Man is either here and now or he dreams of heaven. Intuition expands the possibilities, leaving the boundaries of the finite. You do not have to be here or now if everything can be anything. Sensation concentrates details of the finite world, creating a single meaning. You are here and now, as all proper names for all things.</p>

<p align="justify">On one side of the scale, is the wealth of human imagination. Without it, routine realism will become prison without the past and the future. On the second side of the scale, is the sharp accuracy of the human perception. Without it, your life will become an illusion in which the white is no different from the black.</p>
