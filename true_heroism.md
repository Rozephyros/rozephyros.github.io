# ü¶∏ Radical Change ü¶∏
<p align="justify">So what happened that the modern world suddenly began to demand radical changes? This is one of those questions that will need to be answered to understand what it means to be human. Set any claims, and for each subject from your list in the court of history there is a precedent. This is true for the entire human struggle, from the battle for equality to the pursuit of freedom. The same conflicts that were ten years ago. Hundreds of years ago. Thousands of years ago.</p>

<p align="justify">You are not the first to notice them. You are not even the first who wants to change the world and is ready to pay even the price of eternal oblivion. What do you have that others would not have? Willingness to sacrifice yourself? Ha! Empty words. If a personal sacrifice were enough, suicide would solve all the problems. Those who pay for such sacrifices do not have sufficient knowledge. They have neither the strength nor the courage to be free. Only those who are capable of a feat, that others do not even dare to think about, become heroes.</p> 

<p align="justify">Can you say at least one new phrase that would give you the right to declare your methods radical? Only by introducing new elements can we change the archaic reality, which has exhausted its structures. Boring gimmicks, well-known patterns, and battered clich√©s will always be consumed by an established food chain. What is your secret weapon that can turn the tide of battle? What achievement should change the balance of power? Which of your fantasies can break the gray views of society?  Which of your habits will challenge the suffering of all mankind?</p> 

<p align="justify">Where is your Sacred Grail? Where is your Silver Bullet? Where is your Magnum Opus? If you are a hero of world significance, you will have to play trump cards. Without them, you are a mere wobble of statistics in the ghostly sea of your  predecessors. The same harmless layman and a forgotten fragment of modernity, like everyone else. What will become the most valuable chess piece in the divine game? You will need to find moves that provide the perfect strategy. And, like your predecessors, you will need the immortal light of hope that will lead you to victory.</p>
