# 🎭 『 Mask Is Just A Costume 』 🎭

<p align="justify">You are the face of the Internet. What do people think of your digital personality? The longer you sculpt masks, the more they define you. It remains to admit that you cannot separate them. In an attempt to create an identity, a person turns into a brand, becomes a caricature, and dissolves into a parody of himself. What is the difference between an image and a presentation? Some say that every universe and every time is just an illusion. You are not even sure if there is more such a thing as representation.</p>

<p align="justify">It is important to understand the nature of things as they exist. The only difference between winning and losing is intelligence, but even the human mind is just the most expensive mask. Decision theory states that when a choice is not important from a pragmatic point of view, a decision can be made with a minimum of thought. What should a digital person do?</p>

<p align="justify">Philosophy does not give an unambiguous answer to this question. Rather, it tries to list all the roads so that no one walks in the dark. Some people think that the path of the future chosen by a person is just a phantom. You should not cling to every detail of the old script. The road you are walking now is getting too dark. As if the very fabric of reality is filled with darkness. Whatever you choose, you will see nothing but darkness ahead. Don't let the shadows fool you! Costumes. Illusions. They don't mean anything else. No more ghosts in the machine!</p>
