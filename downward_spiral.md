# üìâ Downward Spiral üìâ 

<p align="justify">There is no need to look for the source of Ukrainian problems in market methods, private initiatives, and institutions of the liberal economy. In the rating of <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/country/ukraine?version=757">economic freedom</a>, Ukraine is not even in the first hundred countries. For comparison, this is several dozen positions lower than Russia or China, where state institutions are very strong. Ukraine is not a country of private initiative, but political freedom. The current government could not find a way out of political contradictions. The problem is in the people themselves, who are not ready for freedom.</p>

<p align="justify">The main thing is not to forget about our fellow citizens. Russian liberals support Ukraine precisely as a country of freedom. Indeed, Ukraine is politically more free than Russia. We don't have Maidan, they don't have Putin. However, activists should be wary of words that might influence the thinking of their contemporaries. There are still many Russians who do not want to see Ukraine as a free country. They would like it to turn into another ‚Äúfailed‚Äù state.</p>

<p align="justify">Do political freedoms hinder private entrepreneurship? Freedom to express one's position in parliament does not mean broad business opportunities. Freedom of the press and freedom of sale of newspapers are in practice unrelated and should not be confused. Private entrepreneurs are looking for opportunities, not in freedom, but its limitations. Freedom exists in the context of a liberated activity. A country that lacks freedom of private initiative is unlikely to be a good example of a market economy, even if it retains freedom of political participation.</p>

<p align="justify">There is a direct link between government strength and self-employment opportunities. For example, some countries impose restrictions on foreign investment in the interests of the local oligarchy. Low-income citizens with right-wing views tend to support a ‚Äústrong hand‚Äù in the government. In such countries, the overwhelming majority of the electorate remains loyal to their oligarchs, but this does not mean that they are provided with good jobs or quality education. A vicious spiral is created: the oligarchy provides citizens with a low standard of living and repression, which, in turn, feeds an oligarchy that provides a low standard of living and repression.</p>
