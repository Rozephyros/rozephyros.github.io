# üß† Thinking Object üß†

<p align="justify">Can the relationship between object and subject be confused? Is it possible to separate a person from feelings, emotions, and desires? This is certainly an interesting assumption, but it is built on a problematic basis. The only way to draw a line is to erase from public consciousness all the memory of the existence of another person. But if this is done, then why even discuss the influence of personality on The Universe?</p>

<p align="justify">On the one hand, we argue that subjectivity depends on the context of the relationship between psyche and matter. On the other hand, we assume that the goal is independent of subjective influence. It seems that any point of view can be supported by a simple statement of the obvious. However, when details are lost, an important new question arises.</p>

<p align="justify">Does objectivity depend on a person's role in subjective relationships? For example, we consider prices to be objective. But isn't it obvious that they have different relationships with buyers and sellers? If the relationship between the seller and the buyer were as equal as the relationship between object and subject is usually assumed, the price of the good would be the average between the supply price and the demand price.</p>

<p align="justify">We say opinions are subjective, but they have different relationships with readers and editors. If the relationship between the reader and the editor were equivalent to the relationship between the object and the subject, then the opinion of the editor would become the opinion of the readers of the article. This means that at the most abstract level and without clarification, the assertion of subjectivity and objectivity is clearly meaningless. But there is one more fact. Although we are subjective in our own existence as the authors of our own lives, we are completely objective in our role as readers and writers.</p>
