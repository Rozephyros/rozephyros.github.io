# üìñ Critical Authority üìñ

<p align="justify">Can the context of subject-object relations be ignored? There is no philosophical doubt about this. None of the definitions attach importance to the context of the relationship between the ocean of subjectivity and islands of objectivity. But if critics are free to ignore the context, then what is the point of critical theory? If you are not willing to accept the concepts of critical theory, there will be no room for you in the pages of literature.</p>

<p align="justify">The critic's opinion is subjective in the context of the relationship with the author and objectively in the context of the relationship with the reader. The author's opinion is objective. The author of the story said everything he wanted to say. The landscape of the sentences does not depend on the reader. Another thing is the weight of the words of the author, carved in granite. The reader of the story can give the authors as much weight as they wish. The reader's opinion is not true or false, but subjective.</p>

<p align="justify">Should I pay attention to the position of the reader? This is decided by the critical position of each of us. Although a critic's opinion is subjective, it becomes true based on the ability to take into account the undercurrents of subjectivity in the ocean of readers' opinions. What does this mean for the textual reality we live in? Subjectivity and objectivity are no longer dependent on the chosen context. Subjectivity can exist ignoring any context. Objectivity can exist without any reliance on context. Only relationships and their relevance to relationships become the framework of the critical system.</p>

<p align="justify">Is there a way to better understand the question? It is important that there is dependence on any subject, but not the absence of dependence on the subject chosen by the context. I'm ready to go further and say that the concept of truth refers to a situation and an individual. Will this be salvation or disaster? It all depends on the situation and the person. In the end, the author's only foothold is his death. Special thanks to the readers who took the time to read the author's arguments and the smart critics who understand the readers' sympathy.</p>
