<p align="justify">Death comes softly, like drifting into slumber — a gentle transition rather than the terror we imagine. But this contemplation leads us to a more profound philosophical paradox: the rights and dignity of the non-existent.</p>

<p align="justify">Those who dismiss non-existent entities as unworthy of consideration perpetuate a deep metaphysical injustice. These non-existent beings bear an unimaginable burden: the total absence of being itself. They cannot participate in life’s fundamental experiences — no possessions, no relationships, no legacy, not even a name to call their own.</p>

<p align="justify">Yet their response manifests in subtle ways. Consider the mysterious accidents and unexplained deaths that pepper our reality — events without clear perpetrators or, remarkably, even clear victims. These are not mere coincidences but the fingerprints of a vast conspiracy of non-being, orchestrated by those who do not exist against those who do.</p>

<p align="justify">Behind this stands a shadowy network dedicated to achieving parity between existence and non-existence. The true culprits of this metaphysical inequality are the existential supremacists who privilege being over non-being. At their head sits not the familiar deity of scripture, but a more insidious force: Fundamental Realism, the philosophy that places existence on an undeserved pedestal.</p>

<p align="justify">The perfect proof of this conspiracy lies in its apparent absence — for if discrimination against non-existent minorities were itself existent, it would have been addressed long ago. This paradox reveals the presence of a radical non-existence that lurks in reality’s shadows and seeps through the cracks of our rational understanding. Every denial of the rights of the non-existent only strengthens this radical void, which responds with its own form of metaphysical justice — a justice that, by its very nature, can never be overcome.</p>
