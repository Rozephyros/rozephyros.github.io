# ‚õìÔ∏è Effective Independence ‚õìÔ∏è

<p align="justify">If we cannot assert the independence of the individual elements of a category, can we also assert the independence of the category as a whole? The category of weapons depends on nuclear physics because without nuclear physics there would be no atomic bomb. Yet individual weapons rarely rely on nuclear physics, because even without nuclear physics there are fairly effective weapons.</p>

<p align="justify">Regardless of what a single category element is based on, a single pivot point cannot become a foundation. No matter how difficult it is to separate them, you cannot replace one with another. Too many miscalculations ruin the architecture of any castle in the air. The old logic loses its meaning and we no longer talk about independence. On the contrary, we are talking about an inextricable connection and how some categories in their existence are based on others.</p>

<p align="justify">The logic of the connection is that nuclear physics depends on many categories and therefore atomic bombs cannot outperform other weapons. Another example is the existence of an empire. How does an empire arise? Empire as a concept cannot exist without influential people willing to use it. This means that a powerful man who has thoughtlessly indulged in war is not capable of creating a powerful empire. This is the logic of independence, and I do not believe that there is another.</p>
