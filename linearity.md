# 🛠️ Linear Metaphysics 🛠️

<p align="justify">The linear dimensions do not depend on the existence in the consciousness of the subject. A familiar example is the amount of substance in a writing desk. No carpenter counts the number of atoms inside a piece of furniture. However, each writing desk has a strictly known number of atoms. This means that the table is always made of a certain material. For example, wood and glass can be leading substances. In theory, you can even imagine a manufacturer listing the number of atoms in furniture to the nearest atom. But this, of course, does not mean that such a specification is necessary for the physical characteristics.</p>

<p align="justify">The same goes for linear dimensions. The conscious choice of linear dimensions does not determine their existence. The writing desk has a certain volume, which is given by matter and energy. Their existence is associated with the objective properties of matter, but not with the consciousness of the subject. After all, physical characteristics are objective facts, not consequences of psychological conditions. You realize that you are part of a single mass, but your consciousness does not go beyond the event horizon. Even if you can imagine a certain line of history in your mind, your line of destiny will remain imaginary.</p>
