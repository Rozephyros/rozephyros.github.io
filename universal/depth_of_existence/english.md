<p align="justify">As you immerse yourself in research, it is important to develop independent thinking and not rely solely on other people’s conclusions. In solitary contemplation, we can find even greater depth. Recently, two interesting ideas have captured me.</p>

<p align="justify">The first idea has to do with trauma as an attempt to compromise with an unreasonable force. This concept suggests that people may give in to unreasonable demands or attempt to anticipate and prevent arbitrary aggression. I conclude that a world devoid of trauma would produce a realm imbued with true rather than arbitrary rationalizations. The question is how to build such a world based not on false fundamentalism but on true justice.</p>

<p align="justify">The second idea is related to the neutral theory of evolution. It argues that most random mutations are not inherently righteous or malevolent, but rather neutral or even stylistic in nature. This idea raises the question of whether the same can be said of our own choices - perhaps they are not inherently virtuous or vicious, but a matter of aesthetics and personal expression.</p>

<p align="justify">Combining these concepts may pave the way to a world in which mortals are open to new concepts, but these concepts are not arbitrarily imposed. Unreasonable demands are replaced with fairer alternatives. This realm recognizes that randomness cannot be inherently sinful and that our choices exist within a framework of balance.</p>

<p align="justify">The concepts of existential humility and cultivating reverence carry deep meaning. The universe functions according to a universal law that governs the natural and harmonious state of affairs. In today’s world, we are besieged by numerous detrimental influences and must seek enlightenment in the collective subconscious. Such an approach can foster a constructive view of existence and a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the cosmos.</p>

<p align="justify">One possible strategy is to remain detached from all concepts, including detachment itself, but be engaged in the flow of ideas.</p>
