# üèÉ Independent Speed üèÉ

<p align="justify">A person running at full speed may be faster than a person running at half speed, but he is not slower than anyone running at a normal pace. This does not mean that speed is subjective. On the contrary, the essence of speed is independent of bystanders. On the other hand, speed estimates are not observer-independent since each test is performed by an observer and reflects only subjective preferences.</p>

<p align="justify">Subjectivity becomes a superficial factor. The hunter adores the primitiveness of nature and considers it useful for survival. The bench absorbs the blood of the carcass and evaluates it as the most tender meat. However, it is necessary to consider whether the subjectivity of the category is sufficient to determine its existence. To reach a subjective verdict, it is necessary to find grounds outside the objective area of the murder. Find the elements of the category that do not depend on objects and arise only in consciousness.</p>

<p align="justify">The question is whether the judge is ready to take on the task of defining biased justice or whether he will remain silent, remaining part of an undeniable system. It is necessary to master new categories until there is enough fresh information to reason differently. Can you argue that a category as a whole is subjective if certain elements of the category do not meet stringent requirements? When the specific elements of a category are independent of the subject, it cannot be argued that the category as a whole is subjective.</p>

<p align="justify">As long as individual sizes are independent of estimates, sizes do not become a subjective category. But what are these individual elements and how to cope with them? Remember that interdependence is the most important condition of reality. We can say that the subjectivity of a category is an independent criterion for its existence. Denying independence means that the logic of free elements will not conform to the conditions with which the category is associated.</p>

<p align="justify">If even one of the elements is free from speculative categorization, the tip of the iceberg will rise above an ocean of bias. In other words, categorical assessments are inextricably linked to individual subjects. Once we forget about all subjective judgments, we have no choice but to assert that there is the objective speed in the relative world itself.</p>
