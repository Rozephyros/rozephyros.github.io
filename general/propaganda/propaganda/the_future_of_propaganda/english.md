![The Future of Propaganda](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rozephyros/rozephyros.github.io/master/%E3%80%8C%20Reality%20Control%20%E3%80%8D.png)

<p align="justify"><i>«Настоящее путешествие - это не движение к новым границам, а возвращение к себе. Но пройти этот путь может только тот, кто смотрит себе под ноги, а не восхищается собственным отражением.» — Лао-Цзы</i></p>

<p align="justify">Victory is not determined by the budget of the army or the skill of the generals. Victory is determined by the will of people and their desire to live in a free society. When you invest in the army, and not in the development of the country, you simply wait until the army becomes obsolete and the country is surrendered without firing a shot. You must develop the economy before thinking about building an army.</p>

<p align="justify">The only way to realize the country's potential is to increase production. It is no coincidence that Stalin won after investing in industrialization, but the late Soviet Union, which relied on the arms race, no longer exists. But not at all because Gorbachev needed to spend more on propaganda. Our spending on the army and propaganda has grown steadily over the years. The government still convinces us that these investments will pay off. However, I am here today to explain to you why this will not happen.</p>

<p align="justify">Political confrontation develops according to the logic of complicating goals and methods. However, domestic politicians are striving to find the easiest way to solve problems. For us, the conflict will always be in the context of old goals and methods. In other words, even if we linearly develop the country's potential, we are unlikely to be able to solve problems without fundamental investment. More developed countries can always impose fundamentally new forms of conflict that devalue even gigantic, but outdated investments.</p>

<p align="justify">Tomorrow there will be a new army without tanks and screens. What will be the threat? We don't even guess, but it doesn't matter. No one is afraid of what they are not trying to foresee. Russia will not be ready anyway, because we are investing in a fragile superstructure, not in the foundation of society. A war awaits us between the army of the past and the unknown enemy of the future, in which most of the soldiers will be defeated without a declaration of war.</p>

<p align="justify">While you are paying billions for the empty words of propagandists that will be forgotten the next day, China is inventing artificial intelligence, America is improving technology for social manipulation, and new threats are emerging in laboratories around the world. The world is an extremely hostile place, but our society collapses even when outside forces do not challenge it.</p>

<p align="justify">Even if the government does see the light of day, we will be far behind on the road to progress. How can this gap be filled with overblown propaganda? The world is moving towards dark times. Do you want to protect your future? First, protect your present. This is why you must vote. Beautiful words cannot solve the country's problems, even tanks with guns cannot.</p>

<p align="justify">We must make the right choice for the future, while fate is still in our hands. Respect for truth will determine whether the next years in the country will be the best or the worst. In the end, truth always wins, and those who value lies are depleted by the truth. Every old lie requires new lies to protect itself. Who knows if the next lie will be more harmful than the previous ones?</p>

<p align="justify">The more money is spent on falsifying facts, the worse the reality behind the TV screen. The lies are protected by new layers of lies. This means that you need to spend more and more money on increasingly loud statements that are being listened to less and less. Do you know what will be the ultimate truth? You will not be told about it, but the truth is not difficult to see.</p>

<p align="justify">You can't win by throwing money into a black hole. It is vital to stop wasting money on propaganda and other useless government action. Cancel unnecessary orders and programs. This is as unpopular as necessary. Do you think we will be rescued by people from television who are now lying around like cheese in butter? They will betray us at the first opportunity.</p>

<p align="justify">The disintegration of your country will be another piece of news that you see on television and accept as a simple fact of life. Do you want to maintain the status quo or change it? The status quo is death. But the future is life, and you can choose to invest in eternity. Propaganda lives and dies in one day. The future is inevitable and therefore it will prevail.</p>
