#### <i>“Actions can change our lives, but only unforeseen events can change our destiny.”</i>

<p align="justify">A person who learns ten seemingly insignificant things will almost certainly discover a thousand useful ones, because he can associate each of the ten insignificant facts with many useful ones. Making such associations plays an important role in crystallizing intelligence, and this should not be overlooked when facilitating learning. It is easier for us to retain and remember objects in our long-term memory if we create associations based on previous experiences. Instead of trying to remember new information from scratch, it is much more effective to remember it in a familiar context. Problem solving and the search for ideas come to us when the known fits into the blind spots of our mind.</p>

<p align="justify">The human mind is an intriguing but complex structure. Thinking needs a frame of reference. The same person will not recall elementary facts in the middle of the night, but will recall minute details in the right context. Proven solutions tempt us to stay in our comfort zone and think on autopilot. Overestimating our own experiences limits our ability to expand our horizons, to assess situations from different perspectives. As a result, meaningful ideas can become buried under familiar patterns. This is why it is important to have a balanced, comprehensive understanding of reality. Such open-mindedness involves cultivating a desire for novelty and a respect for emptiness.</p>

<p align="justify">The complexity of life transcends all known and conceivable limits. We should not be tempted to dismiss information because it seems insignificant. The value of such information presents itself in a different light over time. Forming a mindset that is always one step ahead requires an acceptance of the unknown and uncertainty. We are constantly faced with new situations that require unfamiliar skills and approaches, forcing us to think beyond our personal experience. By keeping hope and imagination alive, our memory opens the door to uncharted territory. The difference between success and failure is determined less by the strength of our core beliefs than by our ability to swim fearlessly through the vastness of the unknown. A willingness to embrace the future, rather than a belief in the inevitable or a perpetual flight into the past, is the foundation of a healthy psyche.</p>

<p align="justify">Effective decisions do not rely only on known algorithms. Reality takes into account everything you own and everything you are capable of. The strangest ideas can be the most valuable, and the smallest details can be crucial to success. Those who refuse to learn the secrets of the future will live in the shadow of their past. Despite having a beautiful plan, true destiny is often revealed when we retreat from our preconceived notions. Mortals are always at the mercy of the unknown and, as a consequence, must remain adaptable and flexible in the face of emptiness. Man must accept not only what he knows, but also what he can never understand.</p>
