#### <i>“When silence persists, it is as if the heart is filled with sorrow.”</i>

<p align="justify">The state exists as a result of the unity of society. The invariable foundation of all power is social acceptance. When power relies on violence and coercion, the illusion of unity is shattered. Competition between nations is replaced by conflict within society. The use of force forces us to recognize the injustice of power. The state weakens and loses its legitimacy. The rich oligarch, supported by evil mercenaries, becomes a common despot. Citizens are no longer motivated to act in the interest of the state. And then the despot’s swan song becomes hate speech.</p>

<p align="justify">The ruler, who is no longer the leader of society, becomes hysterical. The first cry is to destroy the opponents! The second cry — get rid of freedom of speech! The third cry — brother must go on brother! Panic cries cannot stun society. It is naive to assume that people do not understand what is going on. Citizens analyze and do not stop to realize that they have more room for maneuver than any ruler. From now on, talk of external enemies is seen as cheap propaganda. Society begins to purge itself of hatred. Former enemies begin to unite for a common future. Finally, everyone opposes the dictator who is forced to admit the victory of freedom.</p>
