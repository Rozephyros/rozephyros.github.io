#### <i>“We experience the joy and pain of our existence as one person with a million hearts.”</i>

<p align="justify">Patriotism is defined as love of country, but elites always want to replace love with loyalty to a particular state regime. The elites are terrified of what would happen if people gained freedom and independence. The architects of our oppression want our love for one another to serve their enrichment. The prophets do not want you to question the legends that they were chosen by the gods. Should we deceive people and pretend that a patriot must submit to authority? Lenin’s historical legacy will help put an end to the endless arguments. After the revolution, Lenin became a patriot of the socialist fatherland. Was Lenin a patriot during the revolution? Or did he become a patriot after the creation of the Soviets?</p>

<p align="justify">The people who seized power were not patriots of the monarchy, and Lenin was not a patriot of the monarchy. Nor could they have been patriots of the Soviet Union, which at the time did not even exist in their imagination. Such a political structure as the Soviet Union was unthinkable until conditions in Russia allowed radical ideas to find practical expression. Workers and peasants, dissatisfied with the old world, helped found the Communist Party, which succeeded in completely destroying the bourgeois regime. They had every reason to unite with the enemy of the regime and fight against their own government. How else could they act in a system that rejected them?</p>

<p align="justify">Lenin is as often accused of betrayal as he is seen as the savior of the nation. One can only speculate about the feelings of the revolutionary, but the consequences of his actions, which led to the dramatic collapse of the country’s millennial history, are undeniable. Lenin supported the Soviet government, but never the monarchy or the dynasty. Agreeing with Lenin’s patriotism leads to the conclusion that there was a time when a Russian patriot could speak out against the Russian Empire. And since Lenin’s plans for the Soviet Union did not arise immediately, even after the victory of the revolution, he cannot be a Soviet patriot. How, then, could there be a Leninist patriotism that already denied the monarchy, but still without the red flag?</p>

<p align="justify">Lenin decided to betray a despised government. How, then, did he manage to become a symbol of the people? Before him, a patriot should not have spoken out against the monarchy without renouncing the Russian people, who gave their lives to create a sacred union of Orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality. However, the officious tradition was replaced by the great idea of socialism. Lenin during the revolutionary period was a patriot of the speculative “socialist Fatherland”, but why did the old country or the old regime cease to be “Fatherland” for the patriot? The fact is that monarchist notions of patriotism were superficial. State and ostentatious patriotism focused on museum values rather than on living aspirations: sacrifice, creation, freedom, dignity, loyalty.</p>

<p align="justify">To whom does the notion of “service to the Fatherland” belong? Lenin called the destruction of the Russian state a stage of the revolution designed to ensure the revival of the nation, not its oblivion. The fate of the nation was at stake. It was not so much an ideological whim as a matter of survival. How could a man carry through the centuries more than any other mortal? For millennia, people have pondered how to reach eternity. Who determines what it means to be a country, a nation, or a people? A patriot should not simply be a patriot of a state, cannot be a patriot only of a certain regime, and is not worthy to remain only a patriot of the past.</p>

<p align="justify">To show their love for the Soviet Motherland, our ancestors had to fight under red flags. The history of the Revolution answered the question of patriotism, but its lessons have been forgotten. In Soviet times the word “patriotism” lost its active and creative connotation. Heroes did not live and die for abstract ideas, they lived and died in a decisive moment and for fraternal unity. The true patriot is in harmony with history and in intimacy with his comrades. The only place for the most loyal and devoted patriot is in the trenches of historical struggle. Deep love puts the nation above the interests of government, and the struggle with the past reaches a climax, becoming a historical inevitability.</p>
