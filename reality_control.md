<p align="justify"><i>‚ÄúA real journey is not a movement to new boundaries, but a return to oneself. But only the one who looks at his feet, and does not admire his own reflection, can go this way.‚Äù - Lao Tzu</i></p>

<p align="justify">In practice, there is always a certain hierarchy. People who don't try to influence circumstances. At the next level, people who are ready to shape the circumstances. And at the very top, those chosen by fate find themselves in circumstances that cannot be formed. Real achievements are, as a rule, the achievements of people who are forced to act. You can change the natural order for a brief moment. This usually requires a lot of effort and composure that goes beyond instinct and considered ‚Äúheroic‚Äù. However, the chosen by fate have achieved success not because of their own free will and desire, but in spite of them.</p>

<p align="justify">People cannot completely control their circumstances. Therefore, the best results will be achieved through ordinary luck, which creates more favorable circumstances than the will of man could create. Anyone who relies too much on control over circumstances is mistaken if he believes that he can really control everything. In other words, you need ‚Äúlucky chances‚Äù to get ahead. Failure and success are often determined by factors beyond the control of will and desire. This is useful to consider. You can only rely on natural luck if you accept that certain things are out of your control.</p>

<p align="justify">Whether you are lucky or unlucky in the long run is a matter of fate. ‚ÄúEverything depends on you‚Äù is a more popular position than the idea that nothing depends on you. However, the realistic paradigm is different and it says that you depend on everything. Your current position and the picture of the future always depend on the twists and turns of fate. However, you won't be able to reach your maximum potential if you don't believe in your ability to play with the cards dealt. It is more effective because it does not limit your personal experience of understanding your own capabilities. An open mind forces you to answer unexpected questions and improvise in order to succeed.</p>

<p align="justify">From the pinnacle of a unique destiny, it is best to manage those who are constrained by routine circumstances. Once you understand the nature of the system, you can change it to suit your needs. If you can find unique circumstances to achieve your desires, you can work around limitations and achieve your goals. A separate convenience is that you will never be left to blame, because justice is vulnerable to blind spots. Control over reality opens only to those who know how to paint with new colors on the canvas of the present. The universal constant is change. A man must be flexible. How else could he transcend the limitations of his nature?</p>
