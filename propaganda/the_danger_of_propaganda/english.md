![The Dangers of Propaganda](image.png)

<p align="justify">In recent years, the Russian government has invested heavily in propaganda, promoting the idea that hysteria leads to success. However, propaganda is like a pyramid scheme that promises rewards but ultimately disappoints. The political landscape is filled with escalating targets and outdated approaches, leaving domestic policymakers unable to tackle complex problems that require comprehensive solutions. To truly make progress, we must invest in reality itself, rather than relying on empty promises.</p>

<p align="justify">Many believe that victory is not determined solely by military might or the valor of a general. The will of the people and their desire for a free society are the most important factors in achieving true success. While military investment is important for national security and combat readiness, it must be prioritized after the development of our economy and productive capacity. History shows that focusing solely on the arms race, as the late Soviet Union did, ultimately leads to collapse. The collapse of Soviet society cannot be explained only by unresolved economic and social problems. It is inextricably linked to a fascination with propaganda.</p>

<p align="justify">Russia spends billions on fleeting propaganda, while countries like China and America are making significant advances in artificial intelligence and social manipulation technologies. In addition, new threats are emerging in laboratories around the world. The wars of tomorrow will not be fought with tanks and televisions, but with unprecedented means. To prepare for the future, Russia must invest in a solid foundation and develop the creative forces of our society. It is crucial to anticipate the unknown threats we may face and break free from outdated patterns. Failure to do so will have dire consequences for all.</p>

<p align="justify">Russia is facing challenging times, and to protect our future, we must protect our present. The world is a dangerous place, and even in the absence of external threats, civilization can collapse if the government does not prioritize progress. Propaganda cannot make up for lost time, empty words cannot solve our country’s problems. It is our duty as citizens to make decisions based on truth and refuse self-deception. Only by respecting the truth can we determine whether the coming years will be beneficial or detrimental to our country. Defeating propaganda is crucial to our future.</p>

<p align="justify">Russian propaganda poses a serious threat to our future. Manipulating public opinion and distorting facts has a detrimental effect on our society. It is very important that we invest in the development of our country and not waste resources on empty propaganda. We must strive for truth and reject lies for the sake of our future. As citizens we can make a difference and protect the future of our country. Let's unite, oppose the propaganda and work for a bright and prosperous future.</p>

<p align="justify">Russia will not win by pouring money into a bottomless pit. Persistence in lies leads only to self-destruction. Each old lie generates a new one, even more poisonous than the previous one. Propaganda constantly builds up layers of deception, demanding more and more money to create ever more sensationalized claims that divert attention from the truth. In the end, however, truth always triumphs and the futility of propaganda is bound to be exposed.</p>

<p align="justify">The future is synonymous with life, and we can shape it by investing in eternity. Every investment should unlock the potential of our society, not rob it of its ability to think and create. Relying on propaganda is a grave mistake. Can we honestly believe that those who are now on our screens, reveling in their power, will be our saviors? They will betray us at the first opportunity. But by striving for progress and investing in the future, we can avoid such a fall. Propaganda thrives and dies every day, but the future is inevitable and immortal.</p>

<p align="justify">Lying can only be successful when we voluntarily deceive ourselves. The greatest self-deception is believing that nothing will ever change. Time moves faster than we realize, and in the digital age, the truth cannot be forgotten. It cannot be hidden in a world where it is constantly being revised. Truth triumphs because it is backed up by real action. At a critical moment, society discovers that our lives have been built on deliberate delusions, and it is the bitter truth that establishes real social order. Truth emerges from the depths of delusion and becomes the aged wine at the feast of life.</p>
