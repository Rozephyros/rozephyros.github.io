![The Future of Propaganda](image.png)

#### <i>“And only the truth, my friends, can set you free.”</i>

<p align="justify">Russian spending on propaganda has been steadily increasing over the years. The government continues to convince us that investing in hysteria will pay off. Today, however, I want to tell you why propaganda is like a pyramid scheme. Political confrontation develops according to the logic of complicating goals and methods. Domestic politicians, unfortunately, are used to betting on primitive solutions to problems. This means that our struggle will be waged with obsolete goals and means. No matter how much we build up the country’s potential linearly, a qualitative leap is impossible without investing in reality. More advanced countries can always impose fundamentally new types of conflicts, nullifying large-scale but obsolete efforts.</p>

<p align="justify">Victory is not determined by the wealth of an army or the talent of a general. Victory is determined by the will of the people and their desire to live in a free society. By investing in the army rather than in the development of the country, you simply expect the armaments to become obsolete and the country to surrender without firing a single shot. Before you can think about developing the military, you must first develop the economy. Developing production is the only way to unlock a country’s potential. It is no accident that Stalin won by focusing on industrialization. It is no accident that the late Soviet Union, obsessed with the arms race, no longer exists. And not at all because Gorbachev needed to put everything on propaganda.</p>

<p align="justify">While we spend billions on empty propaganda statements that will be forgotten the next day, China is creating artificial intelligence, America is perfecting methods of social manipulation, and new dangers are sprouting in laboratories around the world. Tomorrow there will be a new war without tanks or television. Russia will be unprepared because we are spending on a fragile superstructure rather than the creative forces of society. What will pose a threat? We have no idea, but it doesn't matter. We will be leading an army of the past, fighting an adversary from the future. There will be no time to adapt to the unfathomable threat. Everyone will lose if they don't start thinking ahead, settling for patterns of the past.</p>

<p align="justify">Russia will face dark times. Do you want to protect your future? Protect your present first. The world is a dangerous place, but civilization collapses even when no outside forces threaten it. Even when the government has an epiphany, Russia will be far behind the progress timetable. How will bloated propaganda make up for lost time? Empty words are not ready to solve the country’s problems. As long as Russia’s fate is in our hands, we must make decisions free of self-delusion. Only respect for the truth will determine whether the next few years in the country will be good or bad. For the sake of the future, propaganda must be defeated.</p>

<p align="justify">Do you know what the ultimate truth will be? The propagandists won't tell it, but the reality is obvious. Russia will not win by throwing money down a black hole. The more money spent on imitation facts, the more reality behind the TV screen is forgotten and ignored. Those who pray for lies bury themselves. Each old lie demands a new one, and each new lie is more poisonous than the old one. Propaganda is covered with new layers of deception. This means that propaganda has to spend more and more money on more and more loud statements designed to divert attention from the truth, which always pays off.</p>

<p align="justify">Do you want to maintain or change the status quo? On the other hand, the future is life, and you can choose it by investing in eternity. Every investment should unlock the potential of society, not rob it of its ability to think and create. Don't put your heart and soul into propaganda. Do you really believe that the TV people, who are now rolling around like cheese in butter, will be your saviors? They will betray us at the first opportunity. The demise of our country will just be another news bulletin that you will watch on TV with an empty head and accept as an inevitable fact of life. Propaganda lives and dies by the day. The future is inevitable and therefore immortal.</p>

<p align="justify">The less you invest in propaganda, the weaker it becomes. Lies are successful only when we are happy to be deceived. The main self-deception is the feeling that nothing will change. Time flows faster than you think. In the digital age, truth is not forgotten. Truth cannot be hidden in a world where it is constantly being revisited. Truth triumphs because it is backed by authentic action. At a critical moment, society discovers that life was founded on deliberate delusion, and the bitter truth establishes social order. Truth emerges from the cellar of delusion and becomes the aged wine at the feast of life.</p>
