<p align="justify">There is a deep connection between compassion for animals, grief over the loss of beautiful things, and even grief over health problems. It is not just the loss of something living, beautiful and intelligent. At a deeper level, it is the loss of the complex design of existence itself. The structures and systems created by living organisms and works of art bring order to the chaos of life. They are the most valuable and precious things in our world. They have a history, a purpose and a destiny. They deserve to be preserved or transformed into something better, contributing to a future in which we play an important role.</p>

<p align="justify">At the heart of this transformative process is the human imagination. Imagination is the force that breathes life into everything. It is the fire that warms our hearts and illuminates our minds. As our intellect develops, we become more capable of finding joy and fulfillment in life. However, in the grand scheme of things, the value of all things is limited. Even if the human spirit is magnificent, it is destined to fade in time. There are two immutable facts in life: madness and destruction. Death, decay, and destruction can be frightening to those who have not yet found their purpose in this world. Yet we are the flame that brings light and meaning to the world around us.</p>
