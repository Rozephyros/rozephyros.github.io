<p align="justify">People are constantly evolving and changing, so no one can experience the same situation twice. This ability to change is the most powerful force in the universe. Even if we have to adapt and transform throughout our lives, it remains our greatest gift. While we may not always be fully aware of the events unfolding around us, it is possible that they are part of a larger plan for the common good.</p>

<p align="justify">In my opinion, conscious individuals are capable of becoming constellations. Although they are physically distant from each other, they are bound together by a common desire for cosmic harmony. Therefore, even in the most difficult circumstances, it is important to maintain an unwavering awareness that there are those who are fighting for us beyond the horizon. While it may seem that God has turned His back on humanity, the resonance of our hearts allows the universe to evolve.</p>

<p align="justify">I often wonder why God cannot find a place for his love amidst the cosmic tragedies that occur on countless other worlds and stars. Despite the horror of infinity, there is hope in our souls. From my perspective, freedom from God reveals a meaning to existence that cannot be found any other way. The Absolute serves as both a guiding light and a limiting principle, and God serves as both a point of reference and an eternal prison. I believe that salvation from such betrayal lies in trusting ourselves rather than trusting in God alone.</p>

<p align="justify">Why do we suffer such heinous events that seemingly are beyond our control? Why do we become victims of such events? According to religion, humans are fallen by nature. However, what is a fall if not an external influence? Religion claims that we are fallen because we have fallen away from God, but such an explanation is akin to saying that we fall because we jump into an abyss. A deceptively simplistic, though technically correct, statement. We fall because of the same Earth that keeps us from falling. We fall because of the same God who convinces us of all our sins. Holy influence makes us more susceptible to the forces of evil that exist in the world. Salvation from falling lies in realizing gravitational pull. Imagine how impossible it is to fall in a cosmic void where the tyranny of celestial bodies and gravitational chains no longer exist.</p>

<p align="justify">Could it be that the current catastrophe is the result of the butterfly effect? We are in a delicate dance between good and evil, subject to fragile dynamics. The only way to achieve balance is to make the right choices and make the necessary changes in the direction we choose. Blind faith will inevitably deceive because it has no rational basis. If faith is not blind, then trust must be based on our ability to judge others. If we believe we are being watched, it is important to take the appropriate precautions to keep ourselves safe. When it comes to our safety, the combination of a courageous spirit and accurate information becomes crucial. Never forget to be aware of your surroundings, seek help from trustworthy people, and take the necessary steps to ensure your physical and spiritual well-being. Above all, always remember that each person contributes to the whole constellation, no matter how lonely his or her star may seem.</p>
