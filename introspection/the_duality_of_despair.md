<p align="justify">In times of despair, when one stands on the edge of an abyss, a simple thought often comes to mind. A thought so simple and at the same time so strong that it feeds the most basic principle of survival. The desire to make one more attempt and step by step overcome the chosen path. A primitive and trivial aspiration, but it is one that builds brick by brick monuments of achievement and inspires great victories. The same concept embodies the essence of despair, and destruction serves as the ultimate symbol of death and nothingness. It is both light and darkness, the will to fight and the price of victory. A reality in which opponents can win despite the loss of their source of strength.</p>

<p align="justify">Blood, sweat and tears flow in one direction, no matter what, driven by the determination to survive. Small battles, crushing defeats and staggering decisions shape our lives and force us to grow above ourselves. When a shot finally hits an unassailable target, we are reminded of our humanity and the fragility of our lives. When we pass through the prism of conflict, we must shine all the colors. To perfect ourselves. Each of us encounters emptiness and looks into our own abysses. We realize that there is always a chance that we will never conquer it, and at the same time we realize that there is also a glimmer of light there that we must keep forever.</p>
