<p align="justify">God is in his heaven, all is right with the world. Is it true? And if it is, how long will this go on? Wake up to plunge headlong into a disgusting nightmare with the frightening title of ¬´Reality¬ª. None of the living is given such a luxury as a safe existence. Whoever has committed to living by tomorrow, this arrogant fool will die no earlier than this day will be sent to the mass grave of history. No matter how perfect is your cherished moment, something unexpected can always happen.</p> 

<p align="justify">Something that crosses out all your successes, talents, wealth, fame, experience, luck and connections. You can begin to think about how to put an end to your past, future, and present with your own hands. What will it be? Maybe a sharp tongue of flame that not only burns your pain but also lets go of a burning mockery? How about the acidity of silence that rips out eyes and swallows flies? Which will dissolve not only you but also your death cry, so fast no one will even notice. Whatever it is, it is bound to happen! Anyone will confirm this to you. And if there are no willing ones, there will be a personal experience. In the monstrous marital agony of the inevitable and unknown, the torments of mortals are born.</p>

<p align="justify">Aren't you scared? Good! Fear wholeheartedly for your mental health! People never had enough food for their sinful flesh. But they always had plenty of food for their own fears. Mortals are free to freely choose. Are you afraid of your life, your power, or your loved ones? Perhaps, you are an aesthete who afraid to be afraid, afraid of yourself, and why the hell not, afraid to stop being afraid? Everything is possible, inevitably possible. My name is Rozephyros. I am terribly afraid to remain the only sane person in this crazy world.</p>
