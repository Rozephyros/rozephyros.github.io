# 🏛️ 「 Step By Step 」 🏛️
<p align="justify">Greatest achievements and crushing defeats. The dazzling radiance of the right decisions. Minor fights and battles that were won with great casualties. Existential emptiness, enslaving all who were mistaken. Blood, sweat, and tears flowing in a single direction. Acceptance of death and the desire to survive. A shot that accurately hits the target despite the invulnerable status. An adversary who wins even after losing the source of his strength.</p>

<p align="justify">At the heart of all this was an idea simple to the point of banality. The thought that at the last moment comes to people standing on the edge of the abyss. The thought that brutally pushes people who are ready to go beyond their lives. The desire to win for the last time. It is this despair that feeds the most important principle of survival. Another move! One more step! One more attempt! The idea that erects indestructible monuments brick by brick. An aspiration that conquers every path step by step.</p>
