<p align="justify">Confidence requires a leap of faith and inspirational madness. Imagine that we are talking about God, which mortals can know. What can we say about the Creator of our universe? Physical reality has 10‚Å¥¬≥‚Åπ‚Å∑ possible states. The number, of course, is unimaginably huge, but still not an indicator of infinite power and absolute imagination.</p> 

<p align="justify">Now, imagine that instead of God we are talking about ourselves. What is the universe that man can create? This question is easy to answer. Throughout your life, you make many decisions. Each of your decisions is a binary choice in favor of black or white, good or evil, Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Each choice doubles the number of states in your possible universe. How many states will accumulate in your Universe, from birth to your death?</p> 

<p align="justify">On average, a person makes 35,000 decisions per day. A year consists of 365 days, and on average people live 70 years. This opens up 235000x365x70 = 10‚Å¥‚Å¥¬≤ states for personal reality. What is all that you can do against the background of what the Creator has already done?</p> 

<p align="justify">Putting numbers together is not as indicative as imagining that all the decisions that you made in your whole life would create the Universe. The fact is that against the background of billions of galaxies, your Universe is tiny and invisible. It is impossible to pick it up, see with the naked eye and even notice it through a microscope. Your reality will be hidden at both the atomic and subatomic levels. The choice that a person makes in his entire life fits into a tiny sphere with a radius of 618 Planck units, which is quadrillion times less than one quark.</p>
