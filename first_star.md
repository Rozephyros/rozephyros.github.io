<p align="justify">Obvious double standards. Where naive connoisseurs talk only about the insane beauty of the picture, veteran critics note that the assessment depends on the consciousness of the object, the prevailing tastes, the way of thinking, and the habits of the viewer. You are a critic of your life and must judge yourself objectively. When an avid critic gives a picture five stars out of five, the layman cannot say that the picture received six or four.</p>

<p align="justify">Thus, the assessment becomes objective. To evaluate is to understand whether a picture evokes emotions or leaves indifferent. This means separating precious feelings from disturbances on the periphery of attention. The work plays a role in history only insofar as it touches the soul. However, real art is multi-layered and cannot set its own trajectory. The viewer, immersed in the external beauty of the picture, moves away from understanding its deep horror. The best works of art are not open to discussion but endlessly call for thought.</p>

<p align="justify">Only a trained eye can appreciate the simplicity and purity of the experience. Only in absolute accuracy does a critical assessment come close to an objective verdict. No one can take an objective point of view that does not depend on personal feelings. Whatever the five ‚Äúdiamond stars‚Äù are, there is a kaleidoscope of subjective reactions behind them. Yet everyone is capable of becoming a critic. The main thing is to understand every layer of your vision, from your deepest beliefs to superficial sympathies. A person's ability not to drown in his own experience separates the thoughtful connoisseur from the thoughtless spectator. </p>
