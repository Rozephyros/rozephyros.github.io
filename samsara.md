# 🔱 Ruined Samsara 🔱

<p align="justify">The most powerful force in the universe. By speeding up electrons in computers and erasing thousands of future lives for one sacrifice of the past, it stood at the very foundation of what is known as progress. Existing in the darkness of the event horizon and in the nightmares of the false prophets of our time, it was as far away from the human world as possible. Man is a linear creature. He lives from moment to moment. Over time, obstacles are erased, and every utopia of the future is built on the ruins of the past.</p>

<p align="justify">Mortals can make a little more or a little less effort to achieve their goals, and even the numerical superiority of three people over one can be fatal. And yet the present can be erased. The human mind can go beyond biological existence. With difficulty, people can, despite their deliberate absurdity, multiply their common efforts and create a world in which their past existence would look like only a shadow of the present. Even streams of time are not protected against short circuits. When the present is erased, the future and the past complete the turn. </p>
