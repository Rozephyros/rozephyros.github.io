# üåæ Enlightened Community üåæ

<p align="justify">For millennia, humanity has striven for unity in communities. Some people think that the person doesn't want to be in a group, but history suggests otherwise. Our ancestors lived in tribes or clans led by an elder respected as a leader. The civilized world community is a communal aggregate. Communities relied on a strong central government with a powerful army to protect the population from harm.</p>

<p align="justify">What is the meaning of an enlightened communal system? Communities that live by conscience meet no resistance either from the state or from capitalism. Problems only arise when you try to create unity out of nothing. When they are not created to overcome obstacles, but because people do not want to be part of the global community. No amount of honest laws and good interests will interfere with the formation of a community. They cherish and encourage them.</p>

<p align="justify">Even among the elite of our time, there are no capitalists who would consider them a threat to themselves. What harm can the community do to Elon Musk? Nothing but a minor annoyance. It is strange to think that he will spend billions and start to disperse communities with electric vehicles. Of course, if the community tries to grab capital under the pretext of revolution, the state will intervene. However, overtly predatory parasitism will at least be evidence that the community is incapable of sustaining honest labor.</p>

<p align="justify">If not for the strong hand of the state, parasitic communities would have collapsed under the weight of the struggle for survival. Ultimately, superficial unity always breaks down. You can see it happening right now. Why not just give up your illusions and build a friendlier society? You have no choice, you are already organized into communities and intend to remain under their authority. It is a fragile system, but it is the only way to ensure the existence of the world community.</p>
